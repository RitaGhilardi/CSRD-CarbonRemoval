Aareal Bank,https://www.aareal-bank.com/fileadmin/downloadlist/DAM_Content/IR/Finanzberichte/2024/20241231_gb_en.pdf,Germany,Financials,Consumer Finance,200,KPMG,1,"Aareal Bank Group's basic approach is to „avoid, reduce, offset"". In line with this, offsetting is only performed for emissions that could not be avoided or reduced using the measures to reduce the carbon footprint from operations described in El-3. Both the reduction measures and climate offsetting contribute to the target of climate-neutral operations through offsetting described in El-4.
The „corresponding adjustments"" methods was used for the first time in reporting year 2024 to offset unavoidable emissions from the Bank's own operations in financial year 2023. The partner that Aareal Bank AG uses to offset the unavoidable emissions has obtained certification for its climate change mitigation projects from both the UN - or to be precise the UN's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) - and the Gold Standard and applies the principle of „avoid before reduce before offset"". In line with this, the offsetting partner only performs carbon offsets for companies if these have already implemented, or are planning, ambitious avoidance and reduction actions within the bounds of what is technically and economically feasible. In addition, all projects are presented transparently and the provider has teams of project specialists who monitor the offsetting projects on the ground.
Aareal Bank AG offsets the unavoidable emissions from its own operation using the Corresponding Adjustments method. Corresponding adjustments avoid double-counting of emissions certificates since only the acquiring country, and not the project country concerned, can count them towards their climate footprint. The offsetting project in question has been successfully operating for a number of years already; it has existed since 2009 and has been constantly enhanced since then. The relevant local production facility was opened in 2020. It is registered as CDM-compliant with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and additionally as a Gold Standard project, and has already been successfully verified a number of times. The certifications guarantee sustainable carbon savings by using independent auditors that are accredited by the UN. At the same time, the projects offer substantial ancillary benefits for the population in the project country concerned (e.g. health protection, the alleviation of poverty, jobs, equal rights and much more).
The provider continuously monitors compliance with the standards using an independent and unpaid advisory council comprising representatives of ministries and NGOs.
As already mentioned, all unavoidable Scope I, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions from business travel in financial year 2023 were offset in 2024. This amounted to 4,825 t COze. The credits cancelled in 2024 for 2023 relate both to Aareal Bank AG and to all subsidiaries including Aareon. All offsetting was performed using a reduction project located outside Europe, which is certified under both the Gold-Standard and the CDM, and which is in line with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The emissions to be offset in financial year 2024 in the amount of 2,000 t COzeq, consisting of Scopes I and 2 as well as business trips from Scope 3, will be retired in 2025. Aareal Bank has entered into a long-term partnership with the provider concerned and plans to continue this in the future as well.","4,825",0,100,"Gold Standard, CDM",0,100,,

carbon credits and financing projects outside its value chain.
In particular, these compensation measures meet the
requirements of ACA levels 3+ and 4+ of the Airport Carbon
Accreditation scheme, which some of the Group's controlled
airports hold. These levels involve offsetting the residual
emissions from Scopes 1 and 2, as well as emissions linked to
employee business travel (Scope 3 Category 6). A number of Groupe ADP airports currently hold level 3+ or
4+ accreditation:
u Level 3+: TAV Airports' Ankara-Esenboğa and Izmir-Adnan
Menderes Airports have both been level 3+, since 2014 and
2016 respectively;
u Level 4+: Amman Airport reached level 4+ in 2022. ParisOrly Airport aims to achieve ACA 4+ status by 2025, and
will therefore be offsetting its residual Scopes  1 and  2
emissions as well as emissions linked to business travel by
Orly employees.
Moreover, hubs in the Paris region have been offsetting their
emissions linked to employee business travel since 2019.
In 2023, Groupe ADP will have offset a total of 16,264 tonnes
of CO2 through the purchase of carbon credits and plans to
cancel a further 14,986  tonnes. For 2024 emissions,
Groupe ADP has not yet purchased or cancelled any carbon
credits outside its value chain. The Group plans to purchase
and cancel at least 14,475 tonnes of CO2. The current minimum quantity of carbon credits used to
offset emissions in the reporting year, which will be
purchased and cancelled in the future, is currently 14,475  tonnes of CO2 (offsetting emissions from Amman
Airport). The quantities of carbon credits needed to offset
emissions from the Izmir-Adnan Menderes and AnkaraEsenboğa hubs, as well as business travel by employees at
Paris airports, will be consolidated in March 2025.
Groupe  ADP has a service provision contract that secures
the purchase of carbon credits until 2030 for its hubs in the
Paris region, enabling it to offset emissions from its sites.
This includes the possibility of meeting the offsetting
requirements of the ACA 4+ for Paris-Orly, a level that this
hub is aiming to achieve by 2025, by offsetting its internal
emissions as well as those linked to its employees' business
travel. When drawing up its GHG assessments, Groupe ADP ensures
that the use of carbon credits is clearly distinct from GHG
emissions and the associated reduction targets. These
carbon credits are used as a complement to direct emission
reduction actions, and their use in no way replaces the
efforts made to reduce internal emissions. Groupe  ADP
discloses the volume and quality of credits purchased (see
table below). Groupe  ADP offsets its emissions by purchasing carbon
credits and investing in projects outside its value chain.
These offsets enable us to meet the requirements of Airport
Carbon Accreditation levels 3+ and 4+, which some of the
Group's airports hold. These levels involve offsetting the
residual emissions from Scopes 1 and 2, as well as emissions
linked to employee business travel (Scope 3 Category 6).
A number of financially controlled airports in the ADP
network are currently accredited to level 3+ or 4+:
u lLevel  3+: Ankara-Esenboga and Izmir-Adnan Menderes
airports have both been level  3+ since 2014 and 2016
respectively;
u level  4+: Amman Airport reached level  4+ in 2022. ParisOrly Airport aims to achieve ACA 4+ status by 2025, and
will therefore be offsetting its residual Scopes  1 and  2
emissions as well as emissions linked to business travel by
Orly employees.
The Paris hubs have also been offsetting their emissions
linked to employee business travel since 2019.
Carbon offset projects include initiatives certified by:
u the Verified Carbon Standard;
u the Clean Development Mechanism;
u the Gold Standard. Groupe  ADP has net-zero decarbonisation targets for the
Paris airports certified by SBTi.
In order to achieve the SBTi net-zero target (see DP
E1-4-32), the Group has validated the principle of a strategy
of investing in carbon capturing projects (as required to
achieve Net-Zero) in order to neutralise residual emissions
by the time we reach our net-zero target. The strategy is
currently being implemented. Investing now allows us to
secure the availability of the necessary volumes of carbon
offsets and to have the flexibility to demand very high
quality standards for these projects. Each Groupe  ADP airport that achieves Airport Carbon
Accreditation levels 3+ or 4+ offsets its residual greenhouse
gas emissions by purchasing certified carbon credits. This
offsetting allows these airports to maintain their ACA+
certification, which is public proof of their commitment.
Through its independent certification process, the ACA
assesses and verifies the carbon management efforts of
airports, including their commitment to offset their residual
emissions annually via its administrator. By reaching or
maintaining these levels, each airport makes a public
commitment to offset its emissions in accordance with the
programme's requirements.
To reinforce this commitment, airports declare their progress
in offsetting in their annual sustainability reports and
communicate their compliance with ACA requirements
through third-party audits every two or three  years. This
ensures total transparency in the use of carbon credits to
achieve the defined climate objectives. For ACA+ levels, airports commit to offsetting their residual
emissions while continuing efforts to directly reduce their
internal emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). These efforts are aligned
with the requirements of ACA certification, which imposes
absolute reduction targets compatible with the IPCC's 1.5°C
net-zero or 2.0°C trajectories. The claims of GHG neutrality made by Groupe ADP airports
and their use of carbon credits neither hinder nor
compromise the achievement of GHG emission reduction
targets. Groupe  ADP considers carbon credits to be a
complementary tool, used solely to offset residual emissions
after all possible direct reduction efforts have been
implemented.",0,,,,,0,"In 2024, the Group entered into a partnership with the
Fondation de l'Université Paris-Saclay to set up a research

Air France-KLM is required to offset the greenhouse gas
emissions of its domestic metropolitan flights. This
mandatory offsetting mechanism applies to domestic
emissions emitted since January 1, 2022 and its scope has
gradually increased from 50% of domestic emissions in
2022 to 70% in 2023 and 100% in 2024.
In 2023, in order to cover the mandatory offset of
518 thousand tons of CO₂ emissions, a portfolio of projects
was audited and communicated to the French
authorities, with 35% of the CO2
 compensation from
projects located in the EU. This process was verified by
third-party auditor Verifavia before restitution to the
French Authority DGAC.
In 2024, the emissions to be covered should be around
700 thousand tons of CO₂, of which 50% will need to be
addressed with European-based projects and the
remaining 50% with international projects. Europeanbased projects are substantially more expensive than
international projects. French projects are based on the
French Label Bas Carbone methodology developed by
the French government.
Air France chose Oklima, a subsidiary of EDF which is
known for its expertise in decarbonization strategy, to
select the various projects which must comply with the
principles of carbon offsetting (measurable, verifiable,
permanent and additional). 100% of the Group projects
met recognized quality standards. Together with Oklima,
Air France is building a comprehensive portfolio to
comply with the 2024 period.
In 2023, Air France selected the Greenfield Solar Power
Mission project by Fortum India (VERRA VCS 2069) as its
international project. The main purpose of this project is
to generate clean electricity through renewable solar
energy sources. The project involves the installation of a
250 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan, India. The project
is directly contributing to India's effort to develop access
to renewable energy, improving the lives and living
conditions of people while also creating jobs and
opportunities for education.

Following the hierarchy outlined above, we
aim to minimize GHG emissions from our
activities as much as possible. Where this
is not feasible, we plan to compensate
emissions from our own operations,
business travel and commuting, by retiring
the same volume of voluntary emission
reduction certificates (VERs, also called
‘offsets’ or ‘carbon credits’) or equivalent,
in a phased approach, starting in 2025.
Although compensating residual emissions
enables us to become GHG neutral, this is
currently not considered a substitute for
reducing our emissions. As part of our
Climate Transition Plan, we have defined
separate (gross) emission reduction targets
that are pursued independently of any
offsetting. We strive to assemble a costeffective offset portfolio from projects that
fulfill best-practice quality criteria –
additionality, permanence, accurate
quantification and transparency – and are
validated by leading third-party standards. In
ASML’s offset portfolio only ‘removal’
offsets (nature- and/or tech-based) are
considered eligible.
The composition of our offset portfolio will
be based on combined guidance from
various external sources, such as the
(Revised) Oxford Principles for Net Zero
Aligned Carbon Offsetting, SBTi’s Beyond
Value Chain Mitigation report, peer
benchmarking and regulatory developments
in the EU. We intend that the initial portfolio
to offset our residual emissions (from 2025
onward) will only contain nature-based
removal projects (such as afforestation and
reforestation), since tech-based options
(such as direct air capture) currently have
limited availability and poor costeffectiveness. These innovative solutions
may, however, be considered as potential
investment opportunities in our ESG
innovation investment program.
In addition to our selection criteria described
above, we will aim to prioritize sourcing
recent vintage offsets from projects in
regions where we operate. This allows us to
maintain closer oversight of project
governance, including the opportunity for inperson site visits, and aligns with our goal of
purchasing offsets where the carbon
removal impact has been achieved in recent
years. Offsetting residual emissions will start
in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, ASML
did not hold any VERs based on existing
contractual agreements.
We define our emissions from own activities
that qualify for compensation as of 2025
as our scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3
categories 6 (business travel) and 7
(employee commuting) emissions.
We expect that compensation as of 2030
for the supply chain emissions (our scope 3
categories 1, 2 and 4) will take place in the
upstream value chain, at the level and
expense of our suppliers. For the remaining
product use emissions (scope 3 category
11), we continue our collaboration with
customers to explore the technical
possibilities to eliminate residual emissions.",0,,,,,,,

guidelines. As part of that, we will follow up on developments
in GHG removals and storage from our own operations and
its upstream and downstream value chain and will consider
nature-based solutions when setting plans for achieving
net-zero. The Vanga Blue Forest project focuses on the restoration and
protection of mangroves, which are significant biogenic sinks.
By employing methodologies such as afforestation, reforestation and soil carbon sequestration, the project enhances
these natural biogenic sinks. Specifically, it achieves GHG
removals through biogenic carbon sequestration via mangrove
restoration. The project follows the approved Verified Carbon
Standard (VCS) methodology VM0033 for Tidal Wetlands and
Seagrass Restoration, ensuring accurate and verifiable calculations of GHG removals.
The project finances various carbon mitigation activities,
including the establishment of community woodlots, promotion
of energy-efficient stoves and sustainable fishing practices.
These activities are designed to reduce pressure on mangrove
forests and enhance the overall carbon sequestration capacity
of the ecosystem. The project is expected to avoid emissions
of over 100,379 tCO2e over a 20-year crediting period, with an

CO2-neutral since 2011. The main focus of the initiative is on avoiding GHG emissions. This is achieved by increasing energy efficiency in core processes, buildings, delivery and transport logistics, as well as by using alternative energy and drive technologies. For more information, please refer to E1-1, E1-2, E1-3.
In addition to these measures, Austrian Post voluntar-
ily purchased carbon credits to offset CO, emissions that cannot currently be avoided as part of its CO2 NEUTRAL DELIVERY initiative in Austria. The offset emissions are GHG emissions related to collection, sorting, delivery and
overhead processes which are unavoidable at this time. This offsetting makes the entire chain COz-neutral - from delivery and the processes at logistics centres and delivery bases through to the emissions of external service providers. This achievement is confirmed every year by TÜV Austria. The Group companies Aras Kargo and feibra also purchased voluntary carbon credits to offset their GHG emissions.
The projects selected have to meet high quality standards, e.g. Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). Austrian Post also supports smaller research projects conducted in partnership with universities. The primary aim of all of these projects is to offset unavoidable emissions.
By purchasing the credits, Austrian Post has sup-
ported a whole number of certified climate protection projects, such as the generation of renewable energy using solar, wind and geothermal power plants. Support for social projects is equally relevant: examples include the development of affordable and efficient ovens for the population in the global South and support for innovative methods for disinfecting water.

travel and transport from warehouses to stores, must be balanced with efforts to sequester
carbon dioxide or counteract emissions in an equivalent amount elsewhere. For 2024, investments have been made in projects through Eken Financing AB, where forests are allowed to
remain longer than planned to sequester more carbon, and through Solvatten AB, which provides people in economic vulnerability with clean and hot water by purifying water with solar
energy to reduce their need for firewood and coal. In addition to social and health benefits,
this leads to reduced climate emissions and counteracting the loss of biodiversity through
reduced felling of trees and shrubs. These investments will cover the Group’s emissions within
its own operations, which during the year amounted to 36,926 tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalents. The carbon credits for the amount of emissions covered are planned to be cancelled in the future, ensuring that the climate compensation is permanent and cannot be double counted.
The projects pertains to both emission reduction projects and absorption projects, where
all carbon credits relates to biogenic emissions. These credits will be issued both within the
EU and outside the EU and are expected to be certified according to the Gold Standard and
Verra VCS quality standards. The projects are ongoing and the credits will not be received by
Axfood until the projects are completed.
Axfood’s net-zero target by 2030 means that emissions are reduced by at least 85% compared to the base year 2020 and that the remaining emissions are climate compensated for.
Neither the net-zero target nor its outcome take these carbon credits into account in order for
the Group to be able to claim carbon neutrality. The scope, methods and frameworks, as well
as how remaining greenhouse gas emissions will be neutralized by 2030, will be reviewed in
connection with Axfood validating climate targets with the Science Based Target initiative.",0,,,,,,,

Spain, the project is located in Valle de Sedano48, in the province of Burgos, where 169.42 hectares of
scrubland are being reforested by changing the land use and introducing various native plants (pinus nigra, pinus
sylvestris, quercus faginea, quercus ilex and crataegus monogyna). In addition, emissions will be offset by
purchasing carbon credits in Mexico, specifically in a project located in Santiago de Papasquiaro49, in the state of Durango, whose main aim is to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through improved forest management,
increasing the accumulation of forest carbon in the region with appropriate forestry work. Total CO2 emissions to
be offset come to 7,078.24 tCO2 equivalent. The carbon credits acquired for offsetting correspond, in the case
of Spain, to projects registered with the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge and, in
the case of projects in Mexico, to those registered with the Climate Action Reserve, endorsed by the
International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance (ICROA).

also participate in voluntary carbon markets.
Within the scope of our activities on the voluntary carbon markets, we offset 0.71 million metric tons of
CO2 equivalents in 2024 (2023: 0.6 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents). We exclusively purchased
certificates from nature-based solutions in 2024. 57% of the CO2 certificates originated from projects
aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. Through the purchase of CO2 certificates, we supported projects aimed
at carbon reduction and capture. All certificates we purchased in 2024 were used for that year. The
projects are implemented in the following countries: Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi, Sierra Leone, the
United States and Uruguay. No projects were supported in the European Union. All of our certificates lie
outside the scope of corresponding adjustments for trade in carbon credits between governments.
We have defined the following specific criteria for our purchase of certificates from climate protection
projects with the goal of a high standard that we will constantly improve and further develop. These criteria
comprise transparency, additionality, permanence, measurability, quality/standards, innovation, impact,
co-benefits, no leakage, no double counting and no net harm.
In 2024, 100% (2023: 100%) of our purchased certificates were verified according to external standards
such as Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), CCB or EcoRegistry. We obtain the opinion of an independent
external service provider to assess their quality and integrity.
We will also need long-term emissions-reduction CO2 certificates in the future to attain our net zero target
by 2050. We define net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as a 90% reduction in our total
greenhouse gas emissions30 compared with the base year 2019.
Through our own initiatives, which we drive forward particularly in our downstream value chain, we
contribute to the reduction and storage of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the Bayer Carbon
Program financially supports farmers who apply sustainable agricultural practices. The relevant data for
quantifying the volume of CO2 stored in the soil is collected directly from farmers with the help of Climate
FieldView™ and surveys, and subsequently certified by an independent expert. The resulting greenhouse
gas emissions certificates can then be sold on the market. All the fields of the farmers participating in the
program are reviewed annually for potential reversals. We are not aware of any notable reversals for 2024.
We acquired the equivalent of 0.1 million metric tons of CO2 from this program in 2024 (2023: 0.1 million
metric tons of CO2 equivalents). More than 359,000 greenhouse gas emissions certificates were issued in
2024 (2023: more than 29,000 greenhouse gas emissions certificates).
We also support a number of smaller projects that we do not, however, include in our published additional
contribution. In addition, we offset greenhouse gas emissions resulting from air travel. In 2024, we offset
0.21 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents of greenhouse gas emissions from air travel (2023: 0.18 million
metric tons of CO2 equivalents). In 2024, we did not make any product-related statements on or assert any
claims to greenhouse gas neutrality in connection with the use of CO2 certificates. ","710,000",43,57,"VCS, CCB",0,0,,

value chain, through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits.
BBVA purchases and retires carbon credits in an amount equivalent to its CO2 emissions from the categories over which it has direct
management capacity (i.e., scopes 1, 2 and categories 5, 6 and 7 of scope 3)51
.
In order to ensure the quality of these carbon credits, BBVA has established certain requirements that the selected projects must
meet, including the obligation for them to be certified under the highest quality standards such as VCS (Verra's Verified Carbon
Standard), Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry (ARC), Climate Action Reserve (CAR) and Plan Vivo and, from 2023, that
projects must be CO2 absorption or capture projects.
Additionally, BBVA has an internal Voluntary Carbon Market standard, based on best practices, to evaluate, among others, the
different types of carbon credits, certifiers and standards and quality criteria (including concepts such as additionality, permanence
and other environmental and social aspects), in order to ensure that projects have a real and verifiable climate impact.
In 2024, BBVA has acquired loans from two forest restoration projects in Mexico (X-Pichil and Santa Elena). This year, the entire
purchase was made through BBVA's carbon credits trading desk. BBVA retires the carbon credits in the year following the reference year, whenever possible, once the complete actual carbon
footprint data is available. If the final footprint is higher than the estimated one, the deficit will be accounted for in the purchase of
credits for the following year, increasing the number of credits to be acquired. If the footprint is lower than estimated, the excess
credits will be retired in the following year.
In 2024, BBVA has retired carbon credits purchased in previous years related to the carbon footprint of 202352:
– Cumare Project (Colombia) (VCS): 47,949 credits retired
– Guanaré Project (Uruguay) (VCS): 2,723 credits retired
– Manantiales Wind Project (Argentina) (VCS): 1,431 credits retired
– Rotor Elektrik Project (Turkey) (Gold Standard): 5,607 credits retired
– Carbioin Project (Mexico) (CAR): 16,000 credits retired
– Community Project: set of forestry projects from ejidos (Mexico) (CAR): 19,000 credits retired
Additionally, in 2024, 91 credits from the Santa Elena Project (Mexico) (CAR) have been retired for the emissions generated during
the 2024 General Shareholders' Meeting. In addition to the purchase of carbon credits, BBVA is contributing to the development of carbon markets through initiatives such as
the following:
– In regulated markets, BBVA participates in government auctions in the EU ETS, offering its customers products to cover
customers' EU ETS-related obligations.
– In voluntary carbon markets, BBVA actively engages with its customers. Additionally, it is one of the investors in
Carbonplace, a carbon credit trading platform.
– BBVA actively participates in webinars and conferences, both internal and external, to promote carbon markets and help
customers manage risks and seize opportunities.
– Furthermore, BBVA is present in the Advisory Board of the European Energy Exchange (EEX) Global Carbon Index Family

Preparing for Net Zero
The BMW Group intends to achieve Net Zero by 2050, which
means reducing CO2e emissions across all scopes within the
value chain by at least 90% compared to the base year. To
achieve this target at this point in time, the BMW Group focuses
within the preparation of Net Zero on the decarbonization of its
value chain. All emissions that cannot be technically reduced further at the point of Net Zero (maximum 10% of total base year
CO2e emissions) must be neutralised from that point onwards
using permanent carbon sinks. The BMW Group supports these projects voluntarily, which
means their yields are not counted towards the Group's CO2e targets. The projects are certified by independent institutions in line
with international standards (for example CSI/EBC C-Sink) and
have to meet a set of strict quality criteria as for instance permanence and additionality of the CO2e storage effects.","25,000",100,0,"CSI, EBC C‑Sink",0,0,"The BMW Group has been supporting the development of new

Bouygues,https://www.bouygues.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bouygues_deu_2024_uk.pdf,France,Infrastructure,Engineering & Construction Services,199,Forvis Mazars & EY,2,"Since	 2022,	 some	 of	the	 Bouygues	 group’s	 business	 segments	 have	 been
voluntarily	financing	carbon	avoidance	or	capture	projects	through	Rejeneo.
Rejeneo,	 an	 initiative	 launched	 in	 2023	 and	 supported	 by	 Elan	 (the
consulting	subsidiary	of	Bouygues	Construction),	aims	to	create	a	consistent
approach	 to	 preserving	 and	 restoring	 natural	 carbon	 sinks	 for	 all	 the
Group’s	business	segments.	Its	goal	is	to	encourage	the	business	segments
and	 their	 customers	 to	 contribute	 to	 the	 development	 of	 carbon	 sinks
through	 participation	 in	 voluntary	 carbon	 markets,	 covering	 their	residual
and	 irreducible	 emissions.	 This	 provides	 another	 way	 of	 helping	 the	 drive
towards	 worldwide	 net	 zero	 without	 detracting	 from	 the	 requirement	to
reduce	GHG	emissions	–	which	has	been	in	progress	for	several	years.	This
mechanism	 dedicated	 to	 the	 engineering	 of	 carbon	 sink	 restoration	 and
backed	by	an	ecosystem	of	 rigorously	selected	partners,	is	 the	entry	point
for	the	business	segments,	supporting	them	in	their	climate	strategies.
The	 Bouygues	 group	 has	 set	 strict	 quality	 criteria	 for	 the	 types	 of	 the
projects	 financed	and	 the	certificates	purchased.	The	 selection	criteria	are
as	follows:
•
•
•
The	 systems	 must	 capture	 carbon	 from	 the	 atmosphere	 and	 store	 it	 in
living	matter	(nature-based	solutions	–	in	connection	with	ESRS	E4).
Projects	 must	 be	 certified	 and	 registered	 in	 accordance	 with	 global
standards	recognised	by	ICROA	(such	as	Verra	or	Gold	Standard)	and	the
French	Low	Carbon	Label.
Projects	 must	 have	 a	 positive	 impact	 on	 local	 populations	 (social	 and
economic	inclusion)	and	on	biodiversity	(see	paragraph	E4-3). The	types	of	projects	funded	according	to	the	defined	criteria	include:
•
•
•
restoration	 of	 degraded	 ecosystems,	 such	 as	 wetlands	 or	 forests,	 to
rebuild	habitats	and	restore	key	ecological	cycles;
tree	 planting	 and	 agroforestry	 in	 strategic	 areas	 to	 promote	 local
biodiversity	while	improving	carbon	capture;
protection	 of	 species	 and	 natural	 habitats	 by	 supporting	 local
conservation	initiatives	and	sustainable	farming	practices. Furthermore,	as	part	of	its	own	operations,	the	Bouygues	group	has	identified
activities	that	have	the	potential	to	absorb	or	store	GHGs	(e.g.	timber-frame
buildings,	 ecological	 engineering	 works	 and	 rewilding	 in	 areas	 already	 built
on).	Research	will	be	conducted	to	estimate	more	precisely	the	potential	for
optimising	this	absorption	in	the	company's	value	chain.
Regarding	 public	allegations	 concerning	 the	 commitment	 to	 global	 carbon
neutrality:
•
•
In	 2021,	 operators	 within	 the	 framework	 of	 the	 French	 Telecoms
Federation	(FFT),	of	which	Bouygues	Telecom	is	a	member,	made	a	joint
commitment:	to	achieve	carbon	neutrality	in	2040	for	scopes	1	and	2.
Bouygues	Immobilier	is	the	only	business	segment	of	the	Bouygues	group
to	have	committed	to	achieving	Net	Zero	targets	by	2050,	as	endorsed	by
the	SBTi	(see	E1-4). In	addition	to	the	priority	decarbonisation	efforts	undertaken	by	the	Group,
this	action	is	a	way	of	contributing	both	to	the	mitigation	of	climate	change
beyond	the	Group's	value	chains.	This	also	contributes	to	the	conservation
and	restoration	of	habitats	critical	for	biodiversity,	to	local	communities	and
to	adaptation	to	climate	change.	However,	and	in	accordance	with	the	GHG
Protocol,	 the	amounts	of	carbon	credits	purchased	are	not	deducted	from

Through its parent company BPER Banca
and Banca Cesare Ponti, the BPER Group carries out projects to offset CO2
 emissions generated in relation to corporate mobility.
This initiative provides funding for climate change mitigation projects in partnership with DKV Euro service.
More specifically, through the use of the eco-friendly DKV CARD CLIMATE fuel card, the offsetting of fleet emissions is certified
for every litre of fuel purchased.
In fact, BPER Banca and Banca Cesare Ponti invest an additional contribution in Myclimate-certified offsetting projects. 
The non-profit organisation Myclimate is one of the main providers of offsetting measures and satisfies the most stringent
standards (CDM - Clean Development Mechanism, Gold Standard and Plan Vivo). The financial contribution raised goes to
support three Myclimate climate protection projects that are Gold Standard certified.
Of the three projects in question, two relate to energy efficiency projects and one to access to water. See the details below:
• installation of solar plants in the Dominican Republic;
• financing for the purchase of efficient stoves in Kenya;
• funding for the development of modern water filtration technology for families and schools through the drinking water project
in Uganda. 
The magnitude of the GHG emission reduction associated with this initiative was 2,322.74 tCO2
e in 2024.
In 2024, BPER Banca also strengthened its cooperation with DHL Express that had been initiated in 2022, with a concrete
commitment to reducing the CO2 emissions of shipments between the Group’s various offices and branches (documentation
produced by the foreign office and business centres, letters of credit, etc.). CO2 emissions can be reduced through the DHL
GoGreen Plus service and the use of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). This sustainable aviation fuel is mixed with conventional
fuel and can reduce emissions by up to 80%. ","2,323",0,100,Gold Standard,0,0,,

Capgemini,https://investors.capgemini.com/en/file/28667?download=1,France,Technology & Communications,Software & IT Services,233,Forvis Mazars,0,"Currently achieving a global net zero by 2050 requires nature and
climate tech solutions for removing carbon from the atmosphere
in addition to global decarbonization efforts, and the voluntary
carbon market offers a mechanism to fund the investment in
solutions that are needed. Whilst our primary focus is on actions
to decarbonize our business, with a target to reduce our carbon
emissions by 90% in absolute terms across all scopes by 2040,
we are also investing in nature and climate tech solutions to abate
and remove carbon from the atmosphere.
Whilst there are a number of different perspectives on the role of
carbon credits, our approach is broadly aligned to the view that
carbon removal credits can be used when a company has met its
long‑term reduction target, to mitigate the final percentage of
emissions which cannot be abated and move towards net zero.
However, we also believe that long‑term corporate objectives are
not sufficiently addressing the high concentration levels of CO2
and other greenhouse gases already in, and continuing to enter,
the atmosphere today.
For these reasons, in addition to reducing our emissions as set
out in our carbon reduction targets, we will retire carbon credits
on a ton‑for‑ton basis against the residual carbon emissions,
associated with our direct operations from 2025 and against the
residual emissions including our supply chain from 2030. We do
not make any public claims about GHG neutrality. We believe it is
essential instead to align on the standards about how to best invest
in carbon removals and abatement through nature and climate
solutions and welcome the ongoing work of organizations such
as the Voluntary Carbon Market Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity
Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (IC-VCM) in this area. For
more details of our approach to nature and climate solutions and the
principles we apply to ensure integrity and credibility, please refer
to Section 4.3.3.2 “Policy contributing to our net zero program”. The table above provides details of the carbon credits retired in
2024 by project, which recognized standards and methodologies
they use, project types, where the projects are located, along with
the volume of carbon credits retired in 2024. For more insights
into some of the projects we are investing in please refer to
Section 4.3.3.3 “Actions contributing to our net zero program”.

responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecological footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before
offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from
our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from
Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality carbon credits.
In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones
of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits
outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta
Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based
methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforestation. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon
emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant”
(wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project”
(biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised quality standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold
Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide socalled Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the
individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon offsetting for banking operations.
Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally verified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 reporting year we offset both current emissions and parts of
emissions from 2023. All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of
emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from
them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore
act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable carbon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to
the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries
where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclusively through projects with generally recognised quality standards
such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan
Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Principles (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach
to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market.
The focus of the projects we select is on countries in the global
South, as these are often the ones most affected by the consequences of climate change.

initiative, the Group undertakes to act in three successive
phases: measure, reduce and compensate. Crédit Mutuel
Arkéa wanted to master the first two phases before starting
work on its carbon contribution in 2024.
Although Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has joined the Net Zero Banking
Alliance initiative with the aim of contributing to the objectives
of the Paris Agreement by participating in a market framework,
it has not made any public claims regarding carbon neutrality
or a net zero objective. In 2024, Crédit  Mutuel Arkéa
nevertheless defined an initial Group framework in terms of
carbon contribution, in addition to the work carried out, and
which is continuing, in terms of carbon intensity targets. This is
a gradual approach to understanding the nature of projects and
the local ecosystem, with the aim of effectively supporting our
customers in their carbon contribution initiatives, in addition to
their actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This
framework sets out Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's strategy, which aims
to support local projects that directly benefit its territories
(historical and national) and its customers, in line with its local
roots. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has adopted the following principles
for analysing projects:
■ giving priority to sustainable and virtuous projects that
generate carbon certificates;
■ using the low-carbon label as a priority to ensure a high
level of quality;
■ prioritising projects managed by a trusted third party to
ensure expertise and good management;
■ with regard to forestry initiatives, limiting itself to actions to
revitalise existing forests rather than initiatives to afforest
agricultural land (applying the reforestation methodology).
This analysis is essential to ensure that carbon initiatives are
aligned with the Group's sustainability and social
responsibility objectives. This strategy establishes a clear
framework for carbon contribution initiatives, emphasising
transparency, local commitment and rigour in the choice of
projects.
In 2024, no carbon certificates outside the Group's value chain
were cancelled. An initial project has been financed, based on
the Eco-Methane method certified by the French Ministry for
Ecological Transition using the low-carbon methodology. This
project, costing €15,270, will make it possible to avoid
greenhouse gas emissions of around 254.5 tonnes of CO2eq in
5 years.",0,,,,,,,

Danone is committed to achieving Net-Zero emissions by 2050. This
commitment includes reducing absolute GHG emissions across
scopes  1, 2, and 3, covering emissions from purchased goods and
services, fuel and energy activities, upstream and downstream
transportation, waste generated in operations, and end-of-life
treatment of sold products. Specifically, Danone targets a 90%
reduction in these emissions by 2050, using 2020 as the baseline year.
Additionally, Danone aims to achieve a 72% reduction in absolute
scopes  1 and 3 FLAG (Forest, Land, and Agriculture) GHG emissions
within the same timeframe. Starting with 21.9  Mt CO₂e in the 2020
baseline, residual emissions by 2050 are projected to approximately
4.7 Mt CO₂e per year.
While Danone’s primary focus is on reducing GHG emissions as much
as possible, some residual emissions will inevitably remain. To achieve
net zero emissions by 2050, Danone plans to permanently remove an
equivalent volume of carbon from the atmosphere and securely store
it through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies aligned with the
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard.
Carbon dioxide “removal” projects differ from “avoidance” projects and
include initiatives like ecosystem restoration, landscape projects, and
carbon capture technologies. Danone will use permanent removal
solutions, leveraging its experience with the Livelihoods Funds, a
partnership it has supported since 2011. This approach will involve
Danone’s own removal projects and the purchase of high-quality
carbon removal credits to effectively and transparently address
residual emissions.
Mitigating emissions beyond the value chain
as part of the transition towards Net Zero
Scientific experts, public authorities, and specialist agencies
acknowledge that financial flows, particularly from high-income to
lower-income countries, are needed to reduce emissions and preserve
and strengthen carbon sinks. In this context, in addition to Danone
action within its value chain, Danone is also contributing to projects
allying decarbonization with other social and environmental benefits.
Livelihoods Funds
Since 2011, Danone has been a funding partner in the Livelihoods
Funds, having launched the first Livelihoods Carbon Fund (LCF). This
initiative aims to restore ecosystems, improve local economies, and
address climate change beyond Danone’s value chain through direct
project engagement rather than solely purchasing carbon credits.
Danone remains actively engaged in the governance and strategic
direction of the Livelihoods Funds at the executive level.
In 2024, some Danone factories, continued to purchase carbon credits
as part of their carbon neutral certification. Decarbonization beyond
the value chain in the form of carbon credits does not account as a
reduction towards the Group's reduction targets.","373,647",63,37,"ACR, VCS, Gold Standard, CDM",0,0,,

consequences and the impact on the environment and biodiversity. We only consider
nature-based CO2e removal projects. These have proven to be effective and benefit

contributions to achieve its voluntary climate change
mitigation target
Beyond the reduction defined by the SBTi targets, the
Lufthansa Group aims to meet its self-imposed goal – to halve
its net carbon emissions by 2030 compared with 2019. This
includes voluntary carbon offsets. These offsets contribute
significantly to the climate change mitigation target. The carbon
offset contributions flow into a portfolio of climate change
mitigation projects, which includes initiatives in various countries around the world, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Currently, the Lufthansa Group is supported in this
endeavour by the organisations myclimate, Climate Austria,
SQUAKE and ClimatePartner. The project portfolio includes
modern, technology-based projects such as CarbonCure’s
sustainable concrete (which captures carbon and stores it
long term in concrete) and Biochar (carbon removal through
plant-based biomass). In doing so, the Lufthansa Group fosters the development of the carbon offset market towards
new technologies and offerings that deliver long-term carbon
sequestration. This standard is recommended by the German
Environment Agency. Passengers contribute through offerings
for more sustainable flying, such as the Green Fares flight
tariff offered by the Lufthansa Group’s airlines Lufthansa Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, SWISS, Edelweiss,
Discover Airlines and Air Dolomiti. In addition to the voluntary
offsetting activities described in this report, the Lufthansa
Group also participates in CORSIA as a mandatory offsetting
scheme in the aviation sector. In the long term, the Lufthansa
Group aims to become carbon neutral by 2050 through measures such as these.
Reducing emissions through measures such as fleet modernisation, improvements in operational efficiency and the use of
SAF is associated with high costs. As a sector that is difficult
to decarbonise, aviation will be reliant on the use of carbon
certificates in the long term.
By using carbon credits, the Lufthansa Group ensures that
measures which help to prevent the generation of GHG in the
first place, such as fleet modernisation, are not hindered.
Investments in operational measures are prioritised over carbon credits as a reduction measure. However, based on the
current state-of-the-art, further reduction measures beyond
those already implemented are not economically viable for the
Lufthansa Group at this time. For this reason, carbon credits
are indispensable as a means of carbon offsetting. In addition,
customers purchase and finance carbon credits. This means
no investment funds become permanently tied up that could
otherwise be allocated to other reduction measures.
All current projects in the Lufthansa Group climate change
mitigation portfolio are certified to a high standard. Over 90%
of these projects are verified against the Gold Standard,
which is recommended by the German Environment Agency.
In addition, two technology-based projects (CarbonCure’s
sustainable concrete and biochar) are certified under the Puro
Earth Standard and the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). Projects by Climate Austria are certified in accordance with local
Austrian standards and national environmental funding regulations. Another local project within Europe is certified under
the MoorFutures Standard.
The amount of retired carbon certificates, as well as the
planned amount of carbon certificates to be retired in the
future, is listed in the following table. The total amount of
carbon credits planned for retirement is exclusively based on
contracts concluded with carbon credit providers. However,
deviations between the planned values and the actual values
may occur for 2025. A detailed description of the calculation
methodologies can be found under ↗ Calculation methods in

emissions by purchasing voluntary carbon certificates. Current projects are
shown in the table below. It provides an overview of carbon credits used in
the reporting year (“carbon credits retired”) and carbon credits to be used in
the future that have already been purchased (“carbon credits still to be
retired”). Retiring certificates means listing their use in the associated
public carbon credit register. In the case of retired credits, we also make transparent the type of project
the credits are based on. We distinguish between reduction and removal
projects: removal projects actively remove emissions from the atmosphere.
Reduction projects, by contrast, avoid emissions compared with an
alternative scenario in which the project is not conducted. Reduction
projects, such as forest-protection projects, make up by far the largest
share of the voluntary carbon credit market. E.ON currently procures a
higher proportion of credits relating to reduction projects than to removal
projects. Reduction projects are also subdivided according to the
certification mechanisms on which they are based. The mechanisms apply
different validation and certification standards for carbon credit projects.
E.ON purchases smaller quantities of removal credits and does not record
any carbon removals from projects in its own value chain. In addition,
carbon credits with a corresponding adjustment (“CA”) label can be
purchased on the market. A CA is a mechanism to prevent double counting
of emission reductions and removals in international transfers of carbon
credits in the accounts of the country of origin and the purchasing
organization. The market for CA credits is still in its early stages, which is
why E.ON has not yet purchased any carbon credits with a CA. E.ON is not
aware of purchased projects that had reversals in the reporting year (cases
in which a project’s carbon sink becomes a source of emissions, such as
through forest fires).",672.06,0,100,"Gold Standard, VCS",0,0,,

accordance with the recommendation of the SBTi initiative, to
use only removal-type carbon credit projects for neutralisation
of carbon emissions. This means that, at most, 10 percent of
emissions at that point can be covered by carbon removal
through carbon credits.
We prioritise abatement within our value chain, and we are
continuously investigating ways to reduce carbon emissions
together with various stakeholders. We are currently focused
on our near-term, science-based target for 2030, with a 42
percent reduction in all scopes of emissions. We will not
use carbon credits for near-term target. Elisa is nevertheless
already investing in additional mitigation actions beyond the
near- and long-term science-based targets.
Currently, Elisa has not developed any projects in its own
operations or value chain for GHG emission removal or
storage, but as part of Elisa’s CTP, we are exploring oppor
-
tunities in this area. However, Elisa adopted the practice of
beyond-value-chain mitigation already in 2020, with the scope
of annually acquiring carbon credits in an amount equal to
the remaining emissions in our own operations, meaning from
fuels (Scope 1) and a small portion of other energy usage
(Scope 2), as well as from waste and from business travel
and employee commuting, including remote working (Scope
3). Beyond-value-chain mitigation thus comprises a valuable
aspect in building the sustainable service offering that Elisa
provides to its customers. Our selected carbon credit projects
also have co-benefits for people and nature.
Over time, Elisa has built a carbon credit portfolio with a
variety of high-quality projects of different types and on
different continents, according to the following motivations: • Mitigate risks with a well-balanced portfolio • Predictability for high-quality carbon credits • Benefit financially from strategic procurement • Adress Elisa’s geographical value chain impacts • Test and learn about available opportunities to support our
transition
When reviewing, deciding, and procuring carbon credits, we
do due diligence as follows: • Additionality: The project reduces carbon emissions that
are not reduced through other initiatives.
• Leakage prevention: Emission reductions from the project
do not leak to other locations or activities.
• Permanence: The project permanently prevents the carbon
emissions from entering the atmosphere.
• Verifiability: An objective third party confirms that emission
reductions from the project are credible.
• Other risk assessment: The project e.g. avoids very
high-risk countries.
Elisa purchased carbon credits from projects that are of high
quality, verified by standard bodies like Gold Standard and
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and in line with the UN
Sustainable Development Goals. The methodologies of these
standards ensure accurate quantification and verification for
various mitigation technologies and processes. To further
lessen risks in the quality of carbon credits, we do additional
vetting to the extent possible together with selected partners.
We follow developments in methodologies and actively
engage in dialogue with providers and other experts or
stakeholders, to continuously develop Elisa’s carbon credit
portfolio. Elisa’s portfolio for beyond-value-chain mitigation currently
consists of both reduction and removal projects. As described
below, Elisa’s active carbon credit portfolio, from which
cancellations have been done for the reporting year, included
removal-type projects from Oxford Category 4 (forest
restoration/reforestation) and Category 5 (biochar), together
with reduction-type projects. We see additional value also in innovation and dialogue
directly with project developers and are for example
supporting initiatives such as solar cooker systems for
village communities in Zambia and mangrove plantations in
Indonesia and the Philippines. We transparently describe all
carbon credit projects in our portfolio, their cancellations,
and related climate and other benefits, further on Elisa’s

regulations and to reflect our commitments while avoiding any
risk of greenwashing, we are assessing the future of such a claim.
We are currently exploring alternative ways to communicate that
cartons are a low-carbon alternative, while continuously working
to further reduce the product carbon footprint.
Our SBTi targets include both a net-zero target and gross emission reduction targets, and there is a need to further assess how
residual emissions are intended to be neutralized. We do not use
carbon credits in our carbon accounting or to reduce reported
Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions. This approach ensures that our emissions data transparently represents actual operational impacts
without adjustments for external offset mechanisms.
Elopak currently holds the CarbonNeutral® company certification in accordance with the 2024 version of the CarbonNeutral®

includes demonstration that emission reduction targets are in
place, and emission reductions are being achieved in accordance with near-term science-aligned reduction targets.

reduce emissions and subsequently offsetting emissions that cannot
be reduced for technical reasons. Enagás follows certain criteria to
offset its residual emissions:
• Mitigation hierarchy: only proceed to offset residual emissions
once the maximum level of reduction has been achieved with the
available technology.
• Offset against credits generated by projects that meet the
following requirements:
◦ Be located in geographic areas where the company is present.
◦ Have quality certificates that guarantee the solvency and
reliability of the projects.
◦ Prioritise nature-based solutions.
Therefore, after applying these criteria, in 2024 Enagás spent 37,856
euros on purchasing carbon credits to offset 8,520 tonnes of CO2e
for the 2023 financial year. For more information, refer to Note ‘4.6
Other Information’ in the Consolidated Annual Accounts. In 2025 it
will offset the emissions derived from its regasification terminals, the
Euskadour compressor station, the corporate fleet and headquarters
via the cancellation of carbon credits amounting 5,839 tonnes of
CO2e, corresponding to 2024. In this way, these facilities have
maintained the carbon neutrality they achieved in 2017 (in the case
of Euskadour, 2020). This compensation was carried out with the
purchase and cancellation of carbon credits for avoided deforestation projects in Peru and the Motor Verde reforestation
project in Spain, developed by Repsol and Sylvestris. Enagás plans to continue its decarbonisation pathway, reaching net
zero in 2040 for scope 1 and 2. During this period, it will prioritise the
reduction and elimination of emissions, committing to offsetting the
remaining emissions in 2040 and in 2050 for scope 3. It will do so by
offsetting its residual emissions with carbon credits from projects
associated with nature-based solutions (reforestation) certified

on a systematic basis at EnBW AG because they fall under the materiality threshold.
The subsidiaries use carbon credits for offsetting a little more widely, although still at a relatively
low level compared to the total emissions of the EnBW Group. The carbon credits are used for two
main reasons. On the one hand, they are used to offset end-user emissions, while on the other hand,
they are used as a measure to achieve climate neutrality at certain investments (Netze BW and
Netze-Gesellschaft Südwest) or also in individual business areas (TransnetBW). Pursuant to the Group-wide reduction targets validated in accordance with the SBTi standard, EnBW
is not currently using carbon credits to achieve the reduction targets described in E1-4 nor will it
do so after 2035. The use of carbon credits from renowned providers is a climate protection measure
outside of the EnBW value chain that reduces greenhouse emissions or removes them from the
atmosphere. Supporting these projects makes an additional contribution alongside the measures
within the EnBW value chain. This contribution is therefore understood as being “beyond value chain
mitigation” because it goes beyond the reduction targets we have set. We have a series of guidelines for the use of carbon credits within the EnBW Group that are designed
to ensure the credibility and integrity of the carbon credits:
• Certification: Verified Carbon Standards or Gold Standard
• Scalability: Possibility of offsetting large volumes
• Diversity of action: Not exclusively reforestation projects
• Age of the allowances: Not older than five years
In preparation for our target of achieving climate neutrality by 2035 and against the background of
recent controversies in the voluntary carbon credit markets, we are currently reviewing these
quality requirements with respect to their validity for the whole EnBW Group and the role of carbon
credits in our climate protection strategy.
The subsidiaries Netze BW, naturenergie and Netze-Gesellschaft Südwest exclusively use credits
from Gold Standard or Verra-certified projects to guarantee their GHG neutrality. naturenergie has
stricter quality standards and selects credits using a catalog of criteria, whereby exclusively ex-post
carbon credits come into consideration. Certain countries are excluded due to their higher risk of

In line with ESRS standards, Eni intends to use carbon credits to achieve its Net Zero target by 2050 for Net GHG lifecycle emissions and Net carbon intensity (Scope 1+2+3), after reducing 90-95% of GHG emissions in the value chain. Currently, most of the carbon credits used by Eni derive from projects for the conservation of natural ecosystems, thereby reducing CO, emissions that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Eni's strategy foresees to progressively increase the share of credits from the so-called Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) projects, which capture CO, directly from the atmosphere (e.g. ecosystem restoration or increase of CO, stocks in the soil through appropriate agricultural practices). The carbon credits used by Eni are certified according to internationally recognized voluntary market standards, such as the Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or the Gold Standard (GS). In addition, the credits are accompanied by an additional certification, such as the Climate Community & Biodiversity Standards (CCBS) or the Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta which attests to their socio environmental benefits (e.g. biodiversity conservation, economic development and improvement of local communities living conditions). In 2019, Eni launched the first Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) activities. These
are projects for the protection, sustainable management of land and restoration of natural ecosystems. These initiatives conserve habitats in which plants and animals live, increase the resilience and adaptive capacities of environmental systems to climate change, and promote local sustainable development. The first projects promoted by Eni were framed within the ""Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation"" (REDD+) scheme, defined and promoted by the United Nations. In addition to these, Eni expanded its initiatives to promote Sustainable Agriculture and Land Management (SALM)57. In this context, Eni has launched a first project in Kenya, the Makueni Agroforestry Carbon Project (MACP), which will be developed over a target area of 40,000 hectares, will bring socio-economic benefits (e.g. stabilization of farmers' income) to about 100,000 local people and will contribute to reducing soil erosion and improving the productivity and fertility of agricultural lands. The application of technological solutions represents an additional lever for offsetting residual emissions. Since 2018, the company has launched the 'Eni for Clean Cooking"" program to develop projects that promote the introduction of improved cooking stoves that reduce of the consumption of wood biomass with the aim of improving people's health conditions and promoting forest conservations. The programme has been launched in Congo, Mozambique, Angola, Rwanda, Tanzania and Ivory Coast reaching around 1.5 million people since the start of the initiatives. The industrial spread of clean cooking
systems also promote the development of entrepreneurship and the ocal economy (i.e. stove production and distribution). In 2024, Eni joined the ""Clean Cooking Declaration: Making 2024 the pivotal year for Clean Cooking', promoted by the IEA during the Africa Summit, to accelerate universal access to more modern cooking systems. In addition to the described project development activity, Plenitude acquires carbon credits mainly through purchases on the voluntary market, in line with the same certification standards used by Eni.

businesses, on the knowledge of the exhausted gas reservoir which in synergy with the existing infrastructures will be reused for the CO, storage and on the expertise gained in the past storage activities.
Thanks to its wide portfolio in different Countries, Eni targets to achieve a gross storage capacity of over 15 mmtonnes/y before 2030 and more than 40 mmtonnes/y after 2030.
In Italy, in August 2024, just 18 months after the Final Investment Decision (FID), was launched the Phase 1 of the Ravenna CCS project, developed jointly with Snam through a 50-50 joint venture.
The project, the first in Italy, consists of several phases, starting with the capture of approximately 20 ktonnes/year of CO, from Eni's natural gas processing plant in Casalborsetti, near Ravenna, to transport and storage in the Porto Corsini Mare Ovest depleted gas field, operated by Eni in the offshore Adriatic.
On an industrial scale, it represents one of the world's most successful capture systems with an efficiency of more than 90% at a CO, concentration of 2.4% and with atmospheric pressure. Another distinctive feature of the project is the powering of the capture plant through the recovery of the self-produced heat energy and electricity from renewable sources, with the result that the volume of CO, captured actually corresponds to the amount abated.In the UK, Eni has established a leadership position with the HyNet North West project under development, selected by the UK government as one of two priority CCS projects (""Track 1"") for the Country. The project aims to decarbonize industrial areas in the North West of England and North Wales through the capture, transport, and storage of CO, emitted by existing local hard-to-abate industrial activities and by the future hydrogen production.
Eni is the 100% operator for CO, transport and storage activities and will convert and reuse its depleted offshore gas fields and part of the existing infrastructure in Liverpool Bay. The activity of CO2 injection is expected to start in the second half of the decade with a stored volume in the reservoir of 4.5 mmtonnes/y in the first phase, increasing to 10 mmtonnes/y after 2030. In the United Kingdom, Eni is also implementing the engineering phase for the development of the Bacton Thames Net Zero CCS project, which includes the storage of CO, in the Hewett offshore depleted gas field, to help decarbonize the south-eastern part of the Country and the London industrial area. Eni is the 100% operator for Co, transport and storage activities and has signed a collaboration agreement with 12 industrial partners from the area's hard-to-abate sectors who have expressed interest in participating in the project. In the Netherlands, following the acquisition of Neptune's assets, Eni is developing the CCS L10 project, which involves the storage of CO2, in the operated depleted gas fields offshore in the North Sea. Eni is a 39% operator of the joint venture that will develop the project.
In 2024, negotiations have been started to define the general terms and conditions with some emitters and consortia operating the
""Aramis"" CO, transport projects and the onshore CO, collection hub in the Rotterdam area ( CO, Next). The issuance of the storage license by the Dutch authorities is expected in the first half of 2025, and the CO, storage is expected to start up by 2030 with a capacity of about 5 million tons/year.
In addition, the CCS portfolio includes projects to manage CO, associated with upstream production under development in North Africa and initiatives under evaluation in the North Sea and in the Asia-Oceania area.",

addressing residual emissions by supporting certified carbon avoidance projects through the purchase of carbon avoidance
credits. By combining emission reduction measures with climate contributions to certified carbon avoidance projects, we
have achieved Carbon Neutrality for Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in all our operations for 2021, 2022, and 2023.
As our planned reduction initiatives continue to drive a sustained decrease in emissions by at least 90 percent of our
Scope 1 and 2 absolute tCO2eq emissions by 2030 versus 2021, we will progressively adjust our climate contribution activities
accordingly. Since 2022, we have partnered with ClimateSeed to support a unique carbon avoidance project, the Sustainability
Community Project in Canada (currently we do not have projects in the EU). This project is certified by the Verified Carbon
Standard (VCS) – Verra, one of the most recognized GHG crediting programs. The Sustainability Community Project pools
more than 800 local carbon-reduction micro-projects by SMEs, municipalities, and NGOs together to provide high additional
social impacts. The GHG reductions come from diverse sources of individual activities such as improved energy efficiency
for buildings, redirection of waste away from landfills, and promotion of fuel-switching activities. Since contributing to this
project, the project developer has been innovating how it manages and monitors the micro-projects through digital solutions
to scale the onboarding of new projects and digitally manage the carbon emissions inventory. The project carrier is
continuously searching for new SME prospects to join their sustainable community, which includes more than 150 members
and more than 1 thousand buildings in the province of Quebec. The project’s main objective is to bring up to 10 thousand
customer facilities together in a “sustainable community” to reduce GHG emissions.
During 2024, we cancelled 77,691 tCO2eq of carbon credits.
Beyond Verra’s project certification, ClimateSeed has developed a comprehensive Project Evaluation Framework
that assesses all critical dimensions of a project, including additionality, permanence, leakage, social safeguards and rights,
benefit-sharing structures, biodiversity impacts, and co-benefits aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
ClimateSeed’s Project Evaluation Framework provides a thorough, multidimensional analysis, highlighting each project’s
strengths and potential risks. This approach enables informed decision-making and ensures the highest standards of
environmental and social integrity. In addition, ClimateSeed conducts rigorous due diligence on project carriers, identifying
the ultimate beneficial owners behind each project to mitigate risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing.
Furthermore, ClimateSeed upholds fair and transparent pricing principles, ensuring: no resale or secondary market
transactions, direct carbon credit retirement on behalf of Ferrari, full traceability and accountability in every transaction.
To reach Carbon Neutrality, our ambition is to cancel carbon credits outside the undertaking’s value chain for the
amount of unavoidable emissions and for which we will not find reduction actions. To date we have in place a framework
agreement, and each year we define the precise amounts of carbon credits to cancel.

As
per FMO’s 2030 Strategy, Climate Action Plan and Forestry Strategy, we will increase our contribution to
GHG removals and storage, by investing more in, for example, forestry and nature-based solutions. For
instance, FMO’s Forestry strategy was launched in 2023 and aims to grow investments in forestry,
including nature-based solutions, sustainable natural forest management, and greenfield plantations.
Projects that contribute to GHG removals and storage are moreover eligible for FMO’s Green Label.
FMO does not yet quantitatively report on emission removals through these activities. This is something
that is being worked on for future reporting.
Even though operational emissions were found to not be material, FMO offsets its operational emissions
from business travel by investing in a mix of different carbon credits. In 2024, FMO has offset 5,869
tonnes of CO2eq, using an equal split of VCS Punjab Agroforestry India credits and VCS Pichacay LFG
Equador credits.
It should be noted that no carbon credits are used to claim emission reductions towards the Power
Generation Emission Reduction Target. The offset emissions are also not deducted from the operational
emissions reported in section 'E1-6 Gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions'. In other words, we
report our gross operational emissions.
Within our own value chain, FMO invests in activities that contribute to carbon removals, including
forestry investments. Currently, we are choosing to not quantitatively assess the GHG removals through
our investment portfolio as we are still waiting on global standards to become clear before deciding on
a sequestration tool/methodology. This includes, for example, the GHG Protocol on Land Sector and
Removals Guidance (expected Q1 2025) and SBTi FINZ standard (expected Q1 2025).
The carbon credits FMO acquires are all retired on a yearly basis. These carbon credits do not originate
from FMO's customers and are therefore outside FMO's value chain. FMO plans to keep offsetting its
market-based operation emissions by purchasing carbon credits, but there are no contractual
agreements for future purchase of carbon credits.
FMO has committed to be net-zero by 2050. Our plan is to achieve this by (1) reducing the emission
intensity at portfolio and investment levels; and (2) increasing investments in carbon removals (primarily
forestry), so that when all carbon equivalent emissions – positive and negative - are aggregated in 2050,
our portfolio emissions are ‘net zero’. Pathways regarding these carbon removals are not developed yet,
as elaborated on in section 'E1-1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation'. FMO will focus in the
short-term on striving to align financial flows with 1.5ºC aligned activities and is working on an
approach to measure this. FMO will consider setting additional targets on the alignment of financial
flows. We will continue to improve our data collection, including at the level of our customers, and use
it to assess our progress, as a component of our climate action workstream ahead.
FMO strives to remain climate neutral in all its operational activities, through energy efficiency,
sustainable energy procurement and compensation through the use of carbon credits. FMO's operational
emission neutralization initiative does not affect the set reduction targets because carbon credits or
removals do not count as emission reductions. Moreover, FMO's material emissions take place in the
downstream value chain. While FMO's operational emissions are not subject to an emission reduction
target, they are considered part of its net zero ambition.","5,869",Not specified,Not specified,VCS,0,0,,

own operations and facilitating the same in its suppliers and the raw materials it uses
for the development of its activity. It therefore plans to further expand GHG removal
projects not only in relation to its own operations, but also upstream and downstream
in the value chain. In the near future, the possibility of undertaking GHG storage projects will be
considered, with the company's current efforts focused on the GHG removal projects
described in the previous sections of this chapter.
Gestamp's decarbonisation strategy is established without taking into consideration
emission compensation tools such as the purchase of carbon credits. However,
considering the trajectory of the sector with respect to electric vehicles, the use of this
residual emissions compensation route is being considered as a lever to meet future
objectives.
Following this line of action, Gestamp is working on accounting for and financing
climate change mitigation projects, as well as generating Energy Saving Certificates
(CAES). As part of the process, the Group is working with an external consultant to
prepare a report that will be verified by a third party for registration and subsequent
sale of certificates. With the aim of making this and other projects that contribute to
decarbonisation more transparent, Gestamp is implementing a blockchain system to
ensure their traceability.
Furthermore, as a result of this consideration, Gestamp is exploring potential projects
that have a double purpose: on the one hand, decarbonisation and obtaining carbon
credits, and on the other, strengthening its social impact in the communities where it is
active.
Projects such as reforestation stand as nature-based solutions that protect, restore and
sustainably manage the ecosystem in the vicinity of industrial plants, and promote

emissions form our own operations by supporting
emission reduction projects that also take social
responsibility. We acknowledge that it will be
difficult to cut absolutely all emissions from our
own operations in order to achieve the goal of
net zero emissions by 2050. Therefore, we will
continue to offset known residual emissions with
carbon credits until 2050, preferably in projects
that reduce emissions, remove and store carbon,
as well as cover social conditions.
In 2023, we carried out a thorough review of
various alternatives for GHG reduction projects
and CCS projects. We have acquired external assistance to ensure documentation of the quality
of the projects, as well as to reduce the risk of
corruption. We also conducted an evaluation in
2024, and have concluded that, this year, we will
support WADI by CIC and CEMAsys (Gold Standard VER) on the advice of our external advisor.
The project will provide safe drinking water and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing
boiling water with a clean and sustainable
disinfection method.
We would also like to contribute to financing
new solutions for carbon sequestration and
storage in forests and soils. We have therefore
continued our agreements with Fossagrim (ISO14064-2) and Down to Earth (Carbon Standards
International, CSI). Through these projects, we
contribute to removing atmospheric greenhouse
gases, while at the same time contributing to the
preservation of forests that would not otherwise
have been preserved, and to ensuring that arable
land receives more nutrients through biochar. By
doing so, we also want to contribute to nature-based solutions that can be important in our
efforts to mitigate nature-related risk, as well as
climate risk. Carbon removal is also identified as
an important solution to reach net zero emissions
in line with SBTi’s recommendations.
The projects are in Norway and India, respectively, so we have no share from projects in the

Group has been voluntarily acquiring carbon credits from the
provider atmosfair since 2022. For the year 2023, credits with
an equivalent value of 10,400 tonnes of CO2 GHG emissions
were acquired from atmosfair in financial year 2024. Plans are in
place for the financial year to cancel carbon credits amounting to
10,400 tonnes of CO2 GHG greenhouse gases. The purchase of
carbon credits is one of the pillars of the three-stage approach to
reducing emissions in own operations, which is anchored in the
climate mitigation section of the Helaba Group’s sustainability
strategy. Further information about the climate mitigation strategy
within the sustainability strategy is provided in the sub-section
“Policies related to climate change and climate mitigation in the
core activity” under “Climate change and climate change mitigation in the core activity”. By purchasing carbon credits from
atmosfair, the Helaba Group is providing effective support to
a climate change mitigation project aimed at reducing carbon
emissions, specifically atmosfair’s “Nepal: Small biogas plants”
project, which promotes the construction of domestic biogas
plants in rural Nepal. These biogas plants supply energy for
cooking, save CO2, contribute to the protection of local woodland and increase the standard of living for families. Since 1 January
2021, atmosfair has been approving projects in accordance with
the new regulations set out under the Paris Climate Agreement.
The projects listed here have already been approved by the host
countries (including the so-called “corresponding adjustments”)
or use CO2 reductions prior to the aforementioned reporting date
so as to exclude double counting. The atmosfair climate change
mitigation project described above is registered twice under the
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (formerly known
as the Clean Development Mechanism, in future Article 6.4 of the
Paris Climate Agreement) and under the Gold Standard, the leading voluntary climate change mitigation standard. In accordance
with these standards, the aforementioned project is reviewed by
an independent auditor within one to two years. The Helaba Group
has also defined clear quality requirements regarding carbon credits. Emissions savings must be permanently and independently
verified in keeping with the concept of permanence. Moreover,
the Helaba Group sets high standards regarding transparency
for projects and only uses certificates where the emissions have
already been reduced or bound at the time of issue.
In addition, OFB also voluntarily acquired carbon credits for the
development of the ATREEUM project at Hanauer Landstraße 211
in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, to enable it to offset the unavoidable CO2 emissions generated during the property’s construction
and 30-year usage period. The concept behind the ATREEUM
project is to build and then run a property that is as sustainable
as possible. The aforementioned carbon credits were acquired
in 2021 but were not reported until financial year 2024 as the
ATREEUM project was only completed on 1 July 2024. The provider
firstclimate was commissioned to broker certified carbon credits
for the three selected climate change mitigation projects. Through
the purchase of these carbon credits, a total of 27,018 tonnes of
CO2 equivalent have been offset, 15,500 tonnes of which were
allocated to the construction phase and 11,518 tonnes to the
operating phase. The organisation Verra confirms and verifies that
the emissions savings in the climate change mitigation projects
are correct and that the carbon credits in question are cancelled
in accordance with the Verified Carbon Standard. As such, there
are no plans to cancel any carbon credits at this point in time.
By purchasing carbon credits from firstclimate, OFB is providing
effective support for one climate change mitigation project aimed
at reducing CO2 emissions and also two climate change mitigation
projects geared towards removing CO2 emissions. The climate
change mitigation project aimed at reducing CO2 emissions
involves supporting the expansion of renewable energy (hydroelectric power plants) in India, while the climate change mitigation
projects for CO2-emission removal relate to a forest conservation
project in Uruguay and a forest conservation project in Peru.
In the two forest conservation projects in Uruguay and Peru, CO2

Hermès is focusing on reducing emissions in its own value chain,
which requires organisational and technological changes, both
internally and with suppliers (as presented in § 2.1.2.1.6).
In addition to this commitment, Hermès uses carbon credits, based
on so‑called “nature‑based (1)” solutions through natural capture
mechanisms (for example, planting) or emission‑avoidance
mechanisms with the implementation of large‑scale projects that take
time to set up over the long term.
This carbon credit strategy is therefore gradual for two main reasons:
◆ on the one hand, so that the priority remains the allocation of
human and financial resources to reducing emissions;
◆ on the other hand, to build projects with local communities, in
compliance with Hermès’ quality and ethics requirements, which
require time.
Hermès wishes to contribute in a proactive way to collective carbon
neutrality by 2050, by putting its investments in carbon credits into
perspective with the level of its emissions. Since 2019, Hermès has
used voluntary carbon credits for its scopes 1 and 2 emissions and,
since 2022, this target also includes emissions from scope 3
upstream and downstream transport. In 2024, the use of Hermès’
voluntary carbon credits represented 15% of its global emissions.
Hermès purchases carbon credits directly from the companies in
charge of the projects, which cancel them on behalf of Hermès. These
credits come from projects with strong environmental and social
requirements and are certifed by the most demanding standards on
the market.
In addition, and in addition to this carbon credit strategy, Hermès is
continuing its studies, work and investments to achieve a “net zero”
objective (using the SBTi standards) by 2050 and has begun in
particular to update the fle to be submitted to SBTi by integrating the
changes to the standard (including FLAG). Since 2012, Hermès has been a partner of the Livelihoods Carbon
Fund (LCF), which aims to improve the living conditions of
disadvantaged communities in a sustainable manner by developing
large‑scale projects with real impact against climate change and
simultaneously contributing to local populations and the restoration of
biodiversity. Ecosystem restoration, agroforestry and conservation
agriculture have the ability not only to sequester carbon sustainably,
but also to enable nature and communities around the world to thrive. The Livelihoods Funds aim to be a start‑up investor (with an
entrepreneurial approach and investment risk) in three types of
projects (ecosystems, agroforestry and energy) in Africa, Asia and
Latin America as well as in France. The funds, launched successively,
include 20 partners in their LCF1, LCF2 and LCF3 compartments. The
initial duration of the funds is 24 years, and the duration of a project
varies between 10 and 20 years. By participating in these three
funds for 12 years now, Hermès is committed to local economic
development, the protection of biodiversity and the fght against
climate change. More than €290 million have thus been collected by
these funds to help disadvantaged communities, the fght against
climate change and the protection of biodiversity. In addition to its investment in the Livelihoods carbon funds, and to
meet its commitments, Hermès has also chosen to support projects
proposed by EcoAct. One of the projects selected, which makes it
possible to obtain Gold Standard certifed carbon credits, is located in Uganda, and consists of equipping local populations with improved
cooking stoves, avoiding the use of charcoal and consequently
deforestation and improving air quality inside homes. Given the long lifespan and the complexity of the projects in which
Hermès is committed through the Livelihoods funds (from 10 to 20
years), it is not possible to communicate specifcally the number of
credits whose cancellation is planned in the future. This information
will therefore not be published in this report.","113,000",0,100,"Gold Standard, VCS",0,0,,

Over and above this, we see various opportunities in our business to make a further contribution through GHG reduction and removal projects. This is mainly done as a service to our clients and must hence be contractually agreed. Consequently, HOCHTIEF proactively promotes the incorporation of such measures into its projects (decarbonization lever 1):
• Certain construction materials such as concrete can absorb carbon during a project's operation— a process known as carbonation. Depending on their longevity, surface porosity, and environmental exposure, such materials can reabsorb a significant proportion of the carbon emitted during production. Deliberately using concrete and other construction materials to absorb and sequester carbon is one way of removing it from the atmosphere. HOCHTIEF aims to continue exploring options like these together with our suppliers and clients.
• Alongside conventional construction materials, bio-based alternatives (such as timber) are playing an increasing role in the market. During their growth phase, these absorb carbon from the atmosphere and store it organically. This can result in a positive net carbon impact when used as a construction material.
• Many of our projects include extensive recultivation and rehabilitation services. This allows HOCHTIEF to restore ecosystems that remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in organic matter.
• Use of biogenic carbon from biomass or biocarbon as a carbon sink for the production of sustainable concrete and asphalt.
Going beyond these examples, we regard GHG removal as an additional part of our climate change mitigation strategy, which combines innovative materials, sustainable processes, and partnership with our clients and suppliers. GHG removal is an area we expect to become an increasingly important requirement for clients.

in collaboration with key partners, carry out due diligence
to select reputable providers, and select projects carefully to
meet and align with verified quality standards, such as Gold
Standard, Puro Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).
For example, British Airways worked in partnership with CUR8

for carbon removals), UNDO (a carbon dioxide removal project
developer specialising in enhanced rock weathering), and
Standard Chartered (representing financial institutions), to
launch a first-of-a-kind financing pilot in 2023, designed to help

committed to purchase more than 33,000 tonnes of carbon
removal credits under this financing structure, delivered by UNDO
(through enhanced rock weathering), and by Standard Chartered
acting as the banking partner. This agreement helps create a
blueprint for carbon removal purchases, by enabling carbon
removal suppliers to access capital in the form of debt financing
via advanced purchase agreements.

Group would therefore reduce absolute emissions by 90% compared to 2020 and residual
emissions would be neutralised in accordance with the highest standards of quality.
The companies of the Group currently undertake certain activities within the framework of
voluntary markets, but in no case are they linked to the achievement of emission reduction
targets. In other words, the Company will only consider using carbon credits to neutralise its
future residual emissions in accordance with best practices.
On the one hand, it occasionally participates in the voluntary carbon credit market on a voluntary
and insignificant basis, occasionally purchasing carbon credits outside its value chain in order to
offset certain actions or events, but these are not counted towards the achievement of its
emission reduction targets, nor are they linked in any way to them. In 2024, 1,543 tn CO2e were
cancelled on a voluntary basis.
Furthermore, in 2023, Iberdrola launched a new business area related to the voluntary carbon
credit market. The company Carbon2Nature (C2N) was created with the mission of developing
high-impact nature-based solutions projects that reduce the overall carbon footprint, improve
biodiversity and promote a sustainable economy.

Purchased and retired COze certificates are not included in the greenhouse gas balance and therefore currently play a minor role in the decarbonisation strategy. The company does not carry out its own projects for greenhouse gas emissions storage and removal. The company's goal is to offset only remaining emissions. From 2050 onwards, the SBTi guidelines stipulate that a maximum of 10 per cent of the remaining Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions may be offset by certificates. Until then, Jungheinrich also plans to offset any remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 2030 onwards, while continuing to prioritise compliance with the SBTi reduction pathways. The quality of the certificates purchased for offsetting emissions is assessed using a comprehensive internal catalogue of criteria that includes over 20 criteria, including compliance with the DIN EN ISO 14068 standard, adherence to SBTi requirements, and maximisation of transparency and socio-ecological effects.
In the reporting year, the company offset 46.9 thousand tonnes of COze. The majority, amounting to 43.4 thousand tonnes of COze, was offset by 19,441 certificates from the
""Energising India"" reduction project, a solar energy project in India. This project aims to avoid COze emissions by using renewable energies. It is certified according to the internationally recognised Gold Standard VER. 92.5 per cent of all certificates in use in 2024 will therefore be subject to this standard. Jungheinrich also obtains 3,500 certificates from the Indonesian ""Gula Gula"" removal project. This gets local communities involved in protecting reforested areas and implements nature-based solutions to ensure the long-term security of COze storage. This includes, for example, the management of fire barriers and protection against illegal deforestation. The project is certified according to the Plan ViVo standard, and Jungheinrich is offsetting 3.5 thousand tonnes of COze, or 7.5 per cent of the total number of certif-icates. All certificates acquired through this project were retired in 2024.
One example of the use of COze certificates is the offsetting of the remaining cradle-to-gate-of-customer emissions from the POWERLiNE truck series by the end of the 2024 reporting year. The truck series is characterised by energy-efficient manufacturing processes, reduced material usage and the use of lithium-ion technology. At the same time, the COze-neutral after-sales services project was rolled out in five countries in 2023. Emissions from after-sales services have since been reduced through optimised route planning, the use of electric after-sales services vehicles and driver training. The remaining emissions were fully offset. Starting in 2024, the emissions calculations have been rolled out in other countries and reduction measures have been derived from them, but without the implementation of any further compensation measures. Therefore, the project is no longer referred to as COze-neutral after-sales services.","46,900",7.5,92.5,"Gold Standard, Plan Vivo",0,0,,

emissions at the end of the year, then negotiate a contract based on the calculated volumes, and cancel these carbon credits
at the beginning of the next year. This means that the amount of carbon credits cancelled in the reporting year is used to offset
our own footprint of the year before. The total amount of carbon credits planned to be cancelled in 2025 is therefore not based
on existing contractual agreements. Since 2021, we have aimed to achieve net climate neutrality with respect to our own operations. We took three steps to achieve
this goal: measure, reduce and offset. As described in ‘Own carbon footprint targets (2.2.3.1.1)’, KBC has set targets to reduce the
CO2
e emissions from its own operations. Avoided emissions are therefore not taken into account as carbon offsets do not
contribute to achieving this target. Each year the emissions from our own operations (i.e. remaining after actions to reduce
emissions) are offset, hence achieving net carbon neutrality. To this end, we have selected high quality projects certified under
internationally recognised standards. Moreover, we specifically chose to invest in projects that address climate change, whilst
simultaneously ensuring additional benefits for local communities and biodiversity conservation. Our due diligence process is
aimed at selecting projects with a demonstrated real-world impact. However, ultimately this process relies on information
supplied by third parties and is dependent on the availability of credits within those projects. The above offsetting is not
validated by an external body other than our assurance provider.","56,000",10,90,VCS,0,0,,

neutralize residual emissions on this scope by using its carbon
credits. To achieve this, it has defined a long-term procurement
policy to enable high-impact projects. Indeed, to ensure a reliable

8,900  tons per year by 2030, allowing it to achieve its net-zero

In order to gain experience with the removal and storage of greenhouse gas emissions today, we invested in a project to store COze outside of our own value chain for the first time in the reporting year. To this end, we expanded our existing financial commitment to the “Efficient wood gasification stoves” climate protection project in India in 2024 to include the storage of COze using biochar. The biochar produced as a by-product of the project can be processed into plant fertilizer together with compost and limestone. By spreading the fertilizer, COze is stored in the soil and thus forms a biogenic sink.

purchase carbon credits to compensate for KLP's remaining direct emissions from its own operations
(scope 1). The purchase of credits covers capture and storage equivalent to 3 tonnes of CO2e. The carbon
credits represent carbon sequestration for at least 1,000 years. All of the storage (100 per cent) is in the
North Sea, within the EEA area, through Northern Lights, which is part of the Langskip CCS project. The
purchased credits represent net CO2 removal. This means that the total volume is calculated by subtracting
CO2 emissions generated directly or indirectly from the production process or from the materials used to
store the CO2, e.g. related to logistics. 100 per cent of the credits will be certified by recognised third
parties: Puro.earth or equivalent. The carbon credits that compensate for KLP’s scope 1 emissions in 2024 are linked to the capture and
permanent storage of greenhouse gas emissions from burning biological waste, developed by the
Norwegian climate credit company Inherit. This means that the carbon credits will contribute to netnegative emissions with a very high degree of certainty. The capture and storage project is in development
and is expected to be completed in 2026. The credits will be cancelled when they are received in 2026 and
will offset KLP’s scope1 emissions for 2023 and 2024. The credits are covered according to what we do not
know from Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The limited scope of carbon credits to compensate for
emissions from our own operations is a result of KLP working systematically to cut emissions from its own
operations over time. KLP buys guarantees of origin for our scope 2 emissions, which means there are no
residual greenhouse gas emissions to compensate for related to electricity consumption.
KLP has not produced a general overview of the scope of voluntary carbon credits related to carbon
capture and storage from our value chain (scope 1-15). Through KLP’s investment portfolio, we are
indirectly involved in the development of greenhouse gas capture and storage facilities.
KLP believes that the most effective way to scale solutions for the capture and storage of emissions is for
the individual players in the economy to take responsibility for compensating for direct emissions from their
operations. So KLP does not compensate for its scope 3 emissions through its own capture and storage
projects or the purchase of carbon credits. KLP’s purchase of carbon credits is not part of our emission

""Employee commuting"" of Scope 3 in beyond value chain mitigation projects. These carbon credits are not regarded as a reduction in GHG emissions for Legrand but help communities and organizations that would not be able to reduce their emissions without additional financing. They are not taken into account in achieving Legrand's reduction targets.
In 2024, GHG emissions amounted to 141,104 tCOze and this was invested in projects relating to electrification and the energy transition in the countries in which the Group operates. The amount canceled in February 2025 for 2024 corresponds to the following projects:
• The Metro Delhi, India project, representing 41,104 tCOze.
This project concerns the creation and commissioning of the new Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) in New Delhi, India.
It is certified by Rina in accordance with the UNFCCC's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
• The Guanaste Wind Farm project, representing 100,000 tCOe. This project involves the development and operation of a wind farm in Costa Rica, in the province of Guanaste. It has been certified by DNV (Det Norske Veritas) in accordance with the criteria of the UNFCCC's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In 2024, Legrand did not invest in GHG removal and storage projects or develop any projects of this kind in its value chain. 100% of the projects it invested in concern reducing GHG emissions in accordance with the UNFCCC's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). None of these projects are within the European Union.
Legrand plans to cancel 544,924 COge in the future. This should apply to the same categories of emissions up to 2027 at least. With its Net Zero ambition, Legrand has made a commitment to remove all residual emissions in 2050 and go further than using reduced and avoided emissions credits. To do this, it is in the process of drawing up a carbon removal strategy, which will be available in the next few years.","141,104",0,100,CDM,0,0,,

gas emissions in its own business activities and
throughout the entire value chain.
The greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be avoided
even after significant reduction at the locations1
operated by the Mercedes-Benz Group (Scope 1 and
Scope 2) have been offset by qualified climate change
mitigation projects since 2022.
Beyond its own locations, the entire Mercedes-Benz
new vehicle fleet is to be net carbon-neutral2
 across
all stages of the value chain and the entire life cycle
by 2039. The Mercedes-Benz Group intends to
compensate for the emissions that cannot be avoided
at that time through offset projects that meet highquality standards.
The Mercedes-Benz Group attaches great importance
to the integrity and quality of the offset projects. All
projects must comply with international accounting
requirements and the quality requirements of the Gold
Standard (high-quality certification standard developed
under the leadership of WWF and with the Federal
Ministry for Environment) or other high-quality
standards. In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group has
the project quality and the calculation methodology for
new compensation projects verified in advance by an
independent third party in order to identify potential
accounting errors and negative impacts, such as on
the environment and society in the project countries,
at an early stage in the interest of risk minimization.
The project implementation is further monitored
continuously through ongoing communication with the
project providers.
The Mercedes-Benz Group’s offset portfolio is also
being continuously developed. Since 2023, the focus
has been gradually shifting from conventional offset
projects that reduce emissions to carbon removal. Both
technological and biological removal solutions play a
role here.
Offsetting emissions through carbon credits is an
additional contribution by the Mercedes-Benz Group
to climate change mitigation that does not negatively
affect the level of ambition or the fulfilment of the
reduction targets in any way. Greenhouse gas
emissions and corresponding reduction targets are
tracked and reported independently of compensation
actions. There is no crediting of CO2
 compensation
towards greenhouse gas emissions or target
achievement.
The required quantity of emission certificates (carbon
credits) is determined and verified using a data tool
based on the reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
The corresponding quantity is then deleted in external registers. Detailed information is determined based on
the project data, documented in an internal database

Minor Hotels Europe & Americas,https://memoriamhea.com/2024/en,Spain,Services,Hotels & Lodging,298,PwC,2,"In its commitment to fight climate change, Minor Hotels Europe & Americas uses the offset of
emissions to give visibility to the Company’s climate commitment by involving customers in
it.
With the new events proposition launched in the last quarter of 2022, the Company calculates
and offsets the carbon footprint attributed to the most relevant events held at the hotels. The
most relevant events are considered to be those in which, due to the number of people in
attendance, the commitment could have a greater impact both among customers and society
as a whole.
The event’s carbon footprint is calculated following the HCMI (Hotel Carbon Measurement
Initiative) methodology, supported by the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance.
In 2024 the carbon footprint of 554 large events was offset, which represented the
neutralisation of 3,934 tonnes of carbon emitted into the atmosphere. For more details on this
initiative, see the following link. In addition, 559.00 tonnes of CO2 eq. have been offset.
The following table also presents the breakdown of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2
equivalent tonnes. In the case of MHEA, no emissions have been removed during the
reporting period. However, the offsets of emissions have been made both through internal
projects and through the acquisition of carbon credits. These carbon credits are offset as part
of the company's commitment to mitigate residual emissions that cannot be reduced directly,
by financing external projects such as ""Uberlândia landfills I and II”.
On the other hand, avoided emissions come from the purchase of green energy and the
production of own renewable energy, which reflects MHE&A's strategic choice for
decarbonisation of its operating model and the integration of sustainable solutions in its value This year, MHE&A has acquired 4000 tonnes of carbon credits that come from two certified
international projects:
■ “Uberlândia landfills I and II” in Brazil, a biogenic project, with Standard for the Global
Goals certification.
■ “Collecting and Destroying Potent Greenhouse Gases” in Thailand, a technological project
certified by the American Carbon Registry.
However, the Company does not plan to use these credits to cancel emissions in 2024 due to
the possibility of using the stock of credits purchased in 2023. The exact number of tonnes
offset during the reporting period will be determined on the annual emissions report closing
date. With regard to emissions that are expected to be offset in the future, this will be
determined on a year-by-year basis in line with the accumulated stock of carbon credits and
any future purchases that may be made to cover specific needs.
MHE&A has currently not defined the scope, methodologies or specific frameworks for the
neutralisation of residual GHG emissions, as these measures will be addressed once the
intermediate targets set for 2030 have been reached, as the net zero emissions target is set for
2050. ",559,100,0,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,,

Despite Nordea’s best efforts to limit its operational carbon footprint, some emissions still remain difficult to
reduce. Nordea has therefore purchased carbon offsets for
all emissions from own operations in order to reduce
equivalent emissions elsewhere. Nordea has supported
the generation of renewable energy through the purchase
of carbon credits up until 2023, meaning that reductionprojects accounted for 100% and that credits were not
issued for these projects within the European Union. These
historical credits are verified against Verra’s Verified
Carbon Standard (83%) and Gold Standard (17%) in 2023.
From 2024 Nordea has switched to a long-term emission removal portfolio building on the adoption of the following guiding principles:
• Nordea will cut own emissions by at least 90–95% by
2050, use high-quality offsets for residual emissions and
regularly revise its offsetting strategy as best practice
evolves.
• Nordea will follow a high ambition path to net zero for its
own operations and related offsetting strategy.
• Nordea will shift from emission avoidance to emission
removal with long-lived storage and a low risk of reversals to the atmosphere.
• Nordea will support the development of net zero aligned
offsetting in its engagement with stakeholders.
• Nordea will align its offsetting strategy with the CSRD
criteria, the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned
Carbon Offsetting and relevant guidance from the
Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.
Nordea’s aim in the future is for all its removals to come
from removal projects, with a preference on high-quality
projects within the Nordic region. This will be reviewed
periodically to gradually cover more and more of estimated GHG emissions until the year 2050 and on the path
for achieving net-zero emissions. Also, on the path to netzero emissions, Nordea has committed to reducing carbon
emissions from own operations by more than 50% by the
end of 2030 and to making a net positive carbon contribution (through offsetting). This means that by the end of
2030 Nordea’s emission removal credits will exceed emissions from own operations. The switch to emission
removal credits entails a higher cost per tCO2e for
Nordea’s operational emissions that is increasingly being
internalised, with the aim to speed up, rather than impede,
the achievement of its GHG emissions reduction targets.
A first five-year project development contract for emission removals was developed with Inherit Carbon Solutions
in 2024 covering a total minimum commitment of 68 428
tCO2e of technology-based high-permanence removal
credits from Danish biogas with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) where the geological storage site is in the
North Sea. Given that the first emissions removal credits
from this contract will be cancelled in 2026 and have not
yet been generated, there are no reversals at this point.
These first emission removal credits for Nordea will be
verified against Puro Standard Geologically Stored Carbon
Methodology for CO2 removal and 100% of the credits will
be issued from within the European Union. The durability is
high and the risk of non-permanence is low for geologically stored carbon as the storage provider is committed to
managing and monitoring potential leakage and reversal
events. The percentage that will qualify as corresponding
adjustment by the host country Denmark is still unknown,
but this will be included in future disclosures.","20,372",0,100,"VCS, Gold Standard",0,0,,

For the Nordex Group, this means compensating for the GHG emissions caused by our direct business activities through the purchase of voluntary carbon credits.
The Nordex Group is in the process of purchasing verified carbon credits to compensate for our 2024 scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The carbon credits will be sourced from accredited projects certified under recognized standards, ensuring the integrity and positive impact of the projects financed through this mechanism.
The following overview shows the CO, certificates purchased and canceled in the reporting year for the GHG emissions of Scopes 1 and 2 from 2023 and the CO, certificate purchases planned in 2025 for the emissions of Scopes 1 and 2 from 2024: It is important to highlight that this compensation does not constitute a dependency nor a requirement for achieving the GHG emissions reduction targets established in the metrics and targets section nor an offset for disclosed GHG emission. On the contrary, it is a voluntary action that serves as an additional incentive for decarbonization, promoting direct and sustainable measures to reduce emissions. While carbon credits offer al mechanism to address residual emissions, the Nordex Group remains committed to prioritizing direct emissions reductions within our operations and value chains. The use of carbon credits is intended only as a supplementary measure in our broader strateay to achieve net-zero emissions.","66,675",0,100,VCS,0,0,,

are following developments in the purchase of climate credits and will continuously assess our approach. Climate credits
are not based on an existing contract but are purchased when the climate accounts for the year have been calculated. Climate credits are not used to compensate for CO2e emissions from the investment portfolio.
As part of achieving the ambition of CO2e neutrality in 2025 for PFA’s Climate Plus products, PFA has made a number of
investments in forests to neutralise CO2 emissions. The negative CO2e emissions (emissions absorbed from the
atmosphere and stored in wood) from PFA’s investments in sustainable forestry amounted to approximately -200,345
tonnes in 2024 based on a conservative estimate available at the time of reporting. Data on our forest investments is
obtained through the American forest management organisation Forest Investment Associates (FIA) and the available
estimate for 2024 is qualified with a reported value. Based on a precautionary principle, the reported data for negative
CO2e emissions is also undergoing a separate independent third-party verification which follows a plan with expected

This is achieved by the cancellation of acquired carbon credits. In 2024, we offset a total of 474 kilotonnes COz-e, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 14.2 million medium-sized oak trees. To plant all these trees an area of 512 million m' would be required, equivalent to 9 times the area of Manhattan. This covers our operational carbon footprint, which includes all CO-e emissions from our sites, business travel, and transportation and distribution. We thereby address climate change outside our own value chain and contribute to the reduction of global COz-e emissions that we cannot eliminate along our own value chain. These activities complement our existing climate strategy and are excluded from our Science Based Targets for emission reductions. Thus, ensuring that these investments do not impede the achievement of our carbon reduction targets.
Philips not only offsets its operational carbon footprint by funding impactful social and environmental projects but is also proactively exploring innovative approaches to directly reduce carbon emissions in its value chain, particularly for unavoidable transport-related emissions.
Although we did not use any biofuels in 2024, we do believe this is a potential lever that can help us reduce our carbon footprint in the future. For future reference we only accept biofuels from wastes, residues and by-products as feedstocks with preference for REDIl Annex IX feedstocks for advanced biofuels. This strategic move not only resulted in a modest reduction of emissions, but also aligns with our commitment to nature-based solutions. Carbon credits planned to be cancelled in the future is 420-450 kilotonnes CO-e in 2025. This future cancellation is a high-level estimate and is subject to change depending on our operational carbon footprint in 2025. We finance projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development
Goals 3 and 12. To ensure these offsets meet our high-quality standard of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting, Philips only procures carbon credits from carbon standards that are endorsed by ICROA, such as VCS Standard and Gold Standard. Each program is also verified by an independent third party. We ensure, through our providers, that the quality criteria of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting are met. In addition, Philips has conducted site visits to some of the projects in our portfolio. None of our credits as of now are subject to corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Philips will follow the developments of Article 6 closely to understand if, and when, any of the projects might become subject to corresponding adjustments. Please note that all removal credits are associated with biogenic sinks and linked to activities outside Philips value chain.
All our carbon offsets drive social, economic and environmental progress in emerging markets. In 2024 we did not retire any carbon credits from removal projects. Our projects include:
Restoring ecosystems and empowering communities through tree planting
In Kenya, subsistence farmers are supported to plant and maintain trees on their land through the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST). This carbon removal project enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and strengthens community resilience, providing co-benefits beyond carbon sequestration. Farmers retain ownership of the trees and their products, receiving training and a share of carbon revenues. As an Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiative, it is a nature-based solution contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard with the CCB label.
Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption
This carbon-emission reduction project is expected to provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. As such, this contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard.
Protecting forests through sustainable production
Deforestation is expected to be reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. Unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced, thereby contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. The forest supports the supply of water to other parts of Ethiopia and neighboring countries. It is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard.
Increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy
In India, the energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation. This is therefore considered a technological solution that also enables an improvement in livelihoods.

partner First Climate AG (First Climate), a project to prevent deforestation in Indonesia (665 tCO₂eq)
and a project for clean drinking water in Kenya and Nigeria (664 tCO₂eq) were selected, each
accounting for half of the total offset, according to defined internal criteria. Both projects are
audited according to internationally recognized quality standards.13 The CO2 certificates from both
projects were acquired by ProSiebenSat.1 Group in June 2024, used for offsetting and retired.

investing in certified, high-quality climate protection projects.
Both the effect from the voluntary compensation by ProSiebenSat.1 Group and the effect from
compensated flight bookings are not included in the CO₂eq footprint and therefore not taken into
account in achieving the CO2eq reduction target. In the financial year 2024, the Group did not carry
out any projects in its own value chain aimed at the removal and storage of greenhouse gases. In addition to these voluntary compensation measures, measures for the active removal and
storage of CO₂ from the atmosphere to offset unavoidable emissions may become particularly
relevant in the development of a climate transition plan. These are to be examined in future as part
of the SBTi climate target setting process. 12 The previous year's figures in this section were not audited by PwC as part of the external audit of the 2024 financial year.

Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard. The Verified Carbon Standard is a global standard for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions.
The Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard is an additional standard in the voluntary offsetting market. It examines the overall
benefit of a project beyond pure emission reductions, with a particular focus on the preservation of biodiversity and the social impact in the
project region. The standard, developed jointly by research institutes, companies and environmental groups, is primarily used in forestry and
agricultural projects. According to the distribution of offset greenhouse gas emissions mentioned in the text, the Gold Standard and Verified

remains the action taken as a last resort. Publicis Groupe has
set itself the intermediate target of achieving carbon

renewable energy as the main lever, thus reducing the
purchase of RECs or Guarantees of Origin (GO). Carbon
offsetting, as part of the committed plans, aims to offset
irreducible Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. In recent years, the
Groupe has included emissions related to business air travel
(part of Scope 3) in the offsetting plan; although these have
been decreasing since 2019, the Company’s economic
growth and the geographical dispersion of clients mean that
there is still a need to meet and work together physically.

In 2020, the Company embarked on an initial five-year
multi-annual project to offset its carbon emissions. This
“VCC Plan 1” includes: 90% of the Gandhi/Pawan program, by purchasing
Voluntary Carbon Credits (VCCs) financing the
deployment of wind farms in three regions: Gujarat,
Karnataka and Maharashtra, with a strong social impact
around the education of children and economic
empowerment of women. This project is aligned with the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7,
8 and 13; 10% of VCCs from the forestry project in Madre de Dios,
Peru, protecting the old-growth forest and its
biodiversity. This project is aligned with SDGs 8, 13 and 15.
In 2024, the Groupe canceled the equivalent of 85,045

since 2020), in accordance with the requirements of the
Paris Agreement. [E1-7-56 (b), E1-7-AR 61]
Since 2022, Publicis Groupe has included Scope 3 emissions
related to air transportation from business travel in its
current offsetting plan. In 2023, a second five-year multiyear project was implemented to build on the first. This
“VCC Plan 2” includes: 85% the continuation of the Gandhi/Pawan program,
which will mean ten years of support for this wind project
in the same three regions of Gujarat, Karnataka and
Maharashtra, with a strong social impact around the
education of children and economic emancipation of
women. This project is aligned with the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 8 and 13; 15% of VCCs come from forestry projects in the United

committed to neutralizing residual emissions
by our net-zero target dates. Carbon removal
solutions are therefore an essential component
of our long-term net-zero planning. Our primary
focus remains on reducing emissions to
minimize residuals as much as possible.
For our scope 1 and 2 emissions, to achieve
net zero by 2040, we will reduce at least 90%
of our baseline emissions and neutralize up
to 10% with carbon removals sourced outside
of our value chain.
Currently, we are focused on emissions
reductions and are not purchasing removals
at scale. To prepare for future needs, we
are developing a sourcing strategy with
a portfolio of solutions to:
ó Secure the supply of high-quality removals
necessary to meet our net-zero goals
ó Incentivize the development and scaling
of removal technologies
ó Ensure that removals align with the
durability and integrity standards required
for our residual emissions
Our net-zero strategy excludes the use
of avoidance offsets, as they do not contribute
to the neutralization of residual emissions.
Instead, we focus solely on carbon removal
solutions that actively remove carbon from
the atmosphere and store it in alignment
with the characteristics of our residual
emissions. Specifically:
ó Fossil-based residual emissions: We aim
to neutralize these with removal solutions
offering high-permanence storage.
ó Nature-based and short-lived residual
emissions: We use removal solutions
with lower-permanence requirements,
appropriate to the emission source.
For scope 3 residual emissions, our approach
is still in development and reflects the
complexity of addressing emissions across our
value chain. Our approach involves engaging
with suppliers, particularly those in agriculture,
to explore applying nature-based solutions in
their operations. For fossil-based residuals,
we aim to support suppliers in identifying
appropriate removal solutions.
As policies and regulations evolve, and as
advancements in carbon removal technologies
progress, we will continue refining our
approach to ensure it both meets our
commitments and contributes meaningfully
to global climate goals.

helps preserve biodiversity and creates jobs in the community. This project is certified by the Ministry for the
Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge. Viñales biomass plant (Chile)
The project entails establishing a biomass cogeneration facility at the Viñales sawmill, located southwest of
Santiago, to produce renewable energy. By generating clean energy, the biomass plant displaces more carbonintensive energy sources, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The plant utilizes residual biomass from
the sawmill and nearby forestry operations to supply renewable electricity to the local grid, supporting Chile’s
sustainable economic development. This project is backed by Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) certification.","2,067",Not specified,Not specified,VCS,Not specified,Not specified,,

Our contributions to climate finance are annual investments in nature-based projects, which have a
positive, quantified impact on the climate and are implemented beyond our value chain. They are
voluntary efforts and do not reduce SAP’s carbon footprint until we reach our reduction and net-zero
target.
Until 2030, SAP is committed to annually financing climate projects that reduce and remove more CO2
from the atmosphere than our own operations (including Scope 1 and 2, and business travel GHG
emissions) produce in a year. SAP achieved this goal in 2024 by funding a diverse portfolio of projects
inside and outside the existing voluntary carbon market infrastructure, which are reducing and
removing approximately 276 kilotons CO2e in total. Projects were either financed through direct
funding (47 kilotons CO2e) or through investments in carbon credits (229 kilotons CO2e), and use an
externally verified methodology to calculate their carbon impact. SAP received carbon credits from its
long-term investment in the Livelihoods Carbon Funds (LCF) and carbon retailers. For the 2024
portfolio and due diligence details, see the table below.
The project portfolio financed by SAP includes reforestation, forest protection, improved forest
management, rural energy, and agroforestry projects implemented in collaboration with local
communities.

procurement of voluntary carbon credits. Beginning with
certification and verification by third-party entities, AVEVA ensures
the integrity of chosen credits. AVEVA supports five distinct
projects through Patch.io, each contributing to AVEVA’s
sustainability goals in terms of beyond the value chain mitigation.
This diverse portfolio of projects showcases the commitment to
making a positive impact across different regions and sectors.
In 2024, the AVEVA portfolio included five diverse carbon credit
projects, each contributing to climate resilience and community
benefits. Carboneers India Biochar enables Indian farmers to
create biochar, sequestering carbon for over hundreds of years,
improving soil health, and supporting sustainable agriculture with
an annual CO2
 sequestration target of 75,000 tonnes. In China, the
Huadu Afforestation project plants native species on barren land,
reducing greenhouse gases and creating 25,615 jobs, 60% of
which are for women, with a projected removal of 21 million tonnes
of CO2
e over 30 years. In France, the Bio Agri Energies Agricole
Biogas project transforms organic waste into biogas, producing
low-carbon energy for over 5,000 households and avoiding
34,000 tonnes of CO2
 emissions over five years. The Mekong River Delta Water Purifier project in Vietnam
distributes efficient water purifiers to reduce wood-burning and
emissions, contributing to both public health and reduced
deforestation. Finally, CarbonCure’s technology, deployed globally,
injects CO2
 into concrete to create low-carbon concrete, achieving
permanent CO2
 storage and demonstrating scalability as a climate
solution.
For the future, the AVEVA portfolio features seven innovative
projects, each contributing to climate resilience, biodiversity, and
community wellbeing. The Banni Grassland Biochar project in India
converts invasive biomass into biochar using KonTiki kilns,
improving soil health and locking away carbon while doubling local
wages and boosting economic growth. In Pakistan, the Delta Blue
Mangrove Restoration reforests degraded Indus Delta areas,
enhancing biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and improving
livelihoods for forest-dependent communities. The Brandon Carbon
Mineralization project in the UK transforms CO2
 emissions into solid
building materials, permanently storing 144 kg of CO2
 per tonne of
aggregate. Cambodia’s HUSK Biochar project creates biocharbased fertilizers that sequester carbon for 1,000 years while
increasing crop yields by 40% and reducing farming costs. Kenya’s
SunCulture Solar Water Pumps enable smallholder farmers to
switch from diesel pumps to solar-powered irrigation, reducing
emissions and enhancing climate resilience. The ruumi Farmland
Regeneration platform supports farmers in adopting sustainable
grazing practices, creating high-quality carbon credits while
improving soil and ecosystem health. Finally, Sky Harvest Deferred
Timber Harvesting leverages tonne-year accounting to accelerate
carbon storage, benefiting biodiversity, rural communities, and
global climate goals.",475,36.84,63.13,VCS,10.53,0,"The Group does not have GHG removals and storage or reversals

Nevertheless, from 2025, the Group aims to invest and contribute to
carbon removal stored in coming years in the geosphere to
progressively match, by 2030, the volume of residual emissions in
our operations (what we call “Net-Zero ready” operations). Initially,
our carbon removals contribution portfolio will include a mix of
nature-based and engineered solutions, with a gradually increasing

As of 2030, to fulfill Schneider Electric’s Net-Zero ready operations
target, the Group aims to use “like-for-like” carbon removal to
increase the share of like-for-like removals to balance the
Company’s operational residual emissions.
Investments in projects that avoid or reduce emissions, or that
remove carbon with nature-based solutions still play an important
role, through the wide social and environmental benefits they bring,

and develops projects that conserve, enhance and restore ecosystems
– such as forests, grasslands and wetlands – to prevent GHG
emissions or reduce atmospheric CO2
 levels. When these entities and
projects begin to issue carbon credits, Shell may choose to participate
in the offtake of these credits as part of its offsetting activities.
Carbon credits may contribute to our aim to become a net-zero
emissions energy business by 2050. They may be used by Shell and its
customers to compensate emissions in line with the carbon mitigation
hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.
We believe that the carbon credits need to have a robust carbon
benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities.
We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credit
projects we invest in are of high quality, and are developed and
certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards.
These include the Verra Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program,
Gold Standard carbon offset certification and the ACR carbon
crediting programme (formerly American Carbon Registry).
We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable,
and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have
been adequately considered. We also buy credits from nature- and
technology-based projects developed by others. We carefully source
and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2024, Shell accounted for the retirement of 17.3 million carbon
credits, of which 16.4 million were related to our NCI (including
2.4 million linked to the sale of energy products).
We also buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects
and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we
purchase and retire from the market. The use of high-quality carbon
credits, if required, is one of the decarbonisation levers available to
Shell. We may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any
remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the carbon
mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We will review and update the planned range of voluntary carbon
credits to be retired in the future as part of the annual operating plan
process. We anticipate that the planned range will fluctuate over time,
reflecting the uncertainty of the energy transition.
In relation to our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we have no
quantitative plans for the use of carbon credits due to the uncertainties
regarding the pace of the energy transition, customer demand and the
related development of our business models in the decades leading up

part of our overall climate mitigation strategy, through measuring
and tracking progress on our carbon emissions from energy
consumption, use of paper, company cars, business travel and
waste. Since 2021, SEB has aimed to offset those GHG emissions
that remain after our efforts to reduce emissions through direct
actions. This is being complemented by our commitment to
review our targets and implement mitigation actions for our own
emissions. For 2024, SEB’s strategy for offsetting residual emissions from our own operations, Scope 1, 2 and 3 category 1–14,
involved the use of carbon credits from outside of our value chain,
through purchasing CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) from Puro.
earth, a carbon removal marketplace. These certificates are from
biochar projects that store carbon for a minimum of 100 years. The
purchased certificates have been formally cancelled during 2024,
ensuring that the associated CO2 removal is accurately accounted
for and not subject to double-counting or resale to another entity.
Biochar achieves CO2 removal through the heating of organic
biomass with limited or no oxygen, such as in pyrolysis or
gasification processes. The biomass undergoes carbonization,
forming biochar—a material with carbon bonds stronger than
those in the parent biomass, making it resistant to degradation
when stored in the environment.
The Puro.earth Biochar Methodology certifies biochar as a
carbon removal tool by setting strict production and storage
requirements. It quantifies sequestered carbon through lifecycle analysis, including emissions from biomass production and
transportation. Certified biochar must demonstrate long-term
storage stability and meet sustainability criteria. Figure 43
outlines SEB’s 2024 GHG credits.
Puro.earth is endorsed by the International Carbon Reduction
and Offset Alliance (ICROA) Code of Best Practice. ICROA
approval is obtained annually through an independent thirdparty compliance audit based on the ICROA Code of Best
Practice. The Code sets out requirements and guidelines
for high integrity and is continuously updated to encompass
best practices.
In addition to GHG credits, SEB has undertaken mitigation
actions to reduce emissions from business air travel through
the purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from SAS. SAS
has strict conditions regarding SAF. This means that it must
be produced from raw materials that require as little land as
possible and do not affect the general availability of crops used
in food production. SAS does not accept waste from palm oil
production as a raw material. Furthermore, SEB engaged in the
EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) by acquiring emission
allowances to offset the remaining residual emissions. In future,
SEB intends to explore additional carbon credits alongside our
direct actions to address our residual emissions.","10,754",100,0,Puro.earth,0,0,,

by purchasing carbon credits. We recognise that carbon
credits alone will not solve the climate crisis. Therefore,
our main strategy is to reduce our own emissions, before
we neutralise any remaining emissions through such
projects. Our purchase of carbon credits is not verified by
a third party, but we purchase this through the provider
Klimate, which conducts due diligence on the projects we
invest in. 57) This includes the collection and assessment
of over 300 data points covering climate impact, integrity,
scope and implementation, and co-benefits such as
biodiversity and local community benefits. All projects
meet high-quality standards. 58)
The carbon credits come exclusively from carbon
removal projects, either through biogenic projects such
as afforestation and soil improvement, or technological
solutions such as direct air capture and geological storage.
This approach is in line with the principles of the Oxford
Offsetting Principles and helps ensure that our climate
efforts are robust, traceable and future-proof.
In 2024, we supported projects equivalent to 1,334
tonnes of CO2 equivalents, broken down as follows:
• Biogenic carbon removals: 1,334 tonnes of CO2e
• Technological carbon removals: 0 tonnes CO2e
The tables below provide a detailed breakdown of carbon
credits cancelled in the reporting year and our plans for
future cancellations.
In addition, we have purchased carbon credits from Inherit
Carbon Solutions and Climeworks, with both deliveries
planned for the future. Through Inherit Carbon Solutions,
we have purchased carbon credits that help finance
carbon capture from biomethane plants. Here, organic
waste, such as sewage and food waste, is handled and
used to produce renewable energy. The waste from this
process contains a high concentration of CO2. Normally,
this is released into the atmosphere, but in this project, the
carbon is captured at the plant and permanently stored in
geological formations.","1,334",100,0,"Plan Vivo, CSI",7.95,0,,

Svenska Handelsbanken,https://www.handelsbanken.com/tron/xgpu/info/contents/v1/document/72-263272,Sweden,Financials,Commercial Banks,120,Deloitte,2,"To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement,
it is not enough to significantly reduce global
emissions. CO2 must also be captured from
the atmosphere and stored (Carbon Capture
and Storage, CCS). This is also referred to as
carbon removal credits, negative emissions or
sequestration projects. To support the development of CCS, Handelsbanken has invested
in carbon removal credits from Puro.earth according to the Puro standard. The certificates are called CORCs.
In 2024, the Bank purchased and cancelled
172 tonnes of CO2 from various biochar suppliers in Europe. Carbon removal credits have
not been offset against the Bank’s total emissions or carbon targets. Biochar is a biogenic
carbon sink that sequesters CO2 from the
atmosphere through a pyrolysis process,
where biomass is converted into biochar at
high temperatures without oxygen. According
to the Puro standard, this results in a very
long-lasting carbon bond with a duration of
over 100 years, minimising the risk of non-permanence. In general, biochar is considered a
nature-based solution, especially if it is made
from organic matter and used to improve soil
fertility and water-holding capacity. The Bank
did not make any other purchases of carbon
removal credits, meaning that 100 per cent
were purchased from EU offset projects and
from a recognised standard. The project does
not count as a corresponding adjustment
under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.
To a lesser extent, Handelsbanken contributed indirectly to the financing of carbon
removal credits through a local energy agreement in Sweden whereby the supplier carbon
offsets for district heating it delivers. The carbon offset volume for 2024 was not available
when this Annual Report was finalised, but
based on the volume for 2023 this is estimated
to be less than 80 tonnes. Carbon offsetting
takes place on the basis of recognised standards.
Handelsbanken does not yet have a developed strategy for neutralising unavoidable
emissions. The Bank also does not have any
existing plans, holdings or agreements regarding carbon credits to be cancelled.",172,100,0,Puro.earth,100,0,,

In 2024, Scope 1, Scope 2 and the reported Scope 3.1.-3.14. GHG emissions by the German units in Talanx's Primary Insurance Group were again offset by purchasing and retiring carbon credits; the amount concerned was 19,335 tCO,e? 5.7% of the offsets were performed directly by an IT infrastructure supplier. [E1-7 56 bJ
The Talanx Group offsets the greenhouse gases it emits using greenhouse gas mitigation and avoidance credits outside the Group's own value chain. [E1-7 AR 57 a]
All the GHG credits purchased come from a nature-based project for reforesting and revegetating agricultural land in Paraguay, which is being run in cooperation with local cattle breeders. At more than 4,400 hectares, this is one of the first large privately funded reforestation projects in the South American country, and has been certified as complying with the global Verified Carbon Standard since 2022.
The greenhouse gas mitigation credits originate from biogenic sinks and meet the requirements set out in Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Talanx Group has been partnering with the project as a provider of both equity and debt finance since 2021. Once again, purchased credits were used for offsetting for the reporting year, and were retired. All of the greenhouse gas mitigation credits that were not purchased but rather provided by an IT supplier originate from a technical project located outside the EU that is run under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initia-tive, and therefore also comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Hannover Re Group offsets its emissions independently using different projects. [E1-7 58 b, 61 C, AR 57 b, c, AR 62 b]
The project for reforesting and revegetating agricultural land in Paraguay has a low environmental risk, since it promotes sustainable agriculture and avoids deforestation. It works with landowners in whose areas of responsibility deforestation is uncommon or even illegal.
Consequently, leakage emissions are extremely small and are considered to be zero. Nevertheless, risk monitoring is ensured over the entire term of the project. [E1-7 AR 57 d]
Offsetting will remain a core element of efforts to ensure sustainable, responsible corporate management in coming years. The Talanx Group understands the need to reduce GHG emissions and aims to play its part in this. Offsetting GHG emissions plays a major role here.
The aim is to promote new trends and innovations in the decarboni-sation sector, but also to weigh these from a risk perspective in our business activities. [E1-7 AR 58 c, AR 63 b]
The Talanx Group's current targets for reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in Germany do not include the use of GHG credits. Conse-quently, the availability and price of GHG credits do not influence the implementation of the targets. GHG credits will serve to offset the Group's remaining emissions, and hence ensure Group-wide GHG neutrality in own operations, from 2030 onwards. The Talanx Group's ambition of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is also defined as including offsetting of remaining and unavoidable emissions.

The project ensures a measurable positive environmental impact through reduced emissions from avoided
deforestation in support of sustainable economic development projects and uses a biogenic sink, as it relies on
the conservation of natural forests that store CO2

the atmosphere (with a maximum of 10%).
Following these premises, emissions that cannot be

generate GHG reduction credits and GHG emission
removal credits.

To this end, high-quality credits procured on the
Voluntary Carbon Market are used. The projects that
generate those carbon credits must meet the following
quality criteria:
• Carbon sequestration projects should preferably be
nature-based, such as reforestation, afforestation or
ecosystem restoration (forests, wetlands, grasslands,
oceans), using native plant species.
• Projects should be able to demonstrate additionality
and long-term impact.
• Projects should provide environmental and social cobenefits, contribute as much as possible to the
achievement of the SDGs, and respect and consider
the rights of local communities and indigenous
peoples.
• Projects should be certified with recognised national/
international accreditation schemes and verified by an
independent accredited third party.
• Projects should preferably be located in countries in
which Telefónica is present, especially in those with
high levels of deforestation, such as Brazil, Peru and
Colombia. It thereby contributes to halting
deforestation in these regions, supporting the
conservation of existing forest carbon reserves and
providing incentives to support indigenous peoples
and local communities.

Since 2019, Telefónica has financed climate change
mitigation measures outside its value chain through the
purchase of carbon credits of nature-based projects. In
2024, 37,655 tCO2e of carbon credits were cancelled,
with 100% of the projects used being biogenic sinks.
E1-7_13, E1-7_14, E1-7_16, E1-7_17
In 2024, 68% of the cancelled carbon credits came from
emissions reduction projects (REDD+), while the
remaining projects were carbon removal projects (ARR)
involving biogenic sinks.
The following table shows the breakdown of the GHG
mitigation projects outside the value chain that were
financed through carbon credits. Telefónica Spain has the credits from the Telefónica
Forest, in Palencia, through which it helps to restore a
degraded agricultural area, transforming it into forest
use, and from another project that restores an area
affected by a forest fire in Caldas de Reis, Galicia, with
native species. Credits have also been cancelled from a
project preventing unplanned deforestation and
degradation of an indigenous reservation situated to the
east of the Colombian region of the Orinoco highlands,
in the transitional belt between the savannas of the
Orinoco and the Amazonian forests. Thanks to these
three projects, the operator offset 28% of its operational
emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in 2024.
Meanwhile, Telefónica Brazil continued to offset 100% of
its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions through the purchase of
carbon credits. The projects support local initiatives for
both the conservation of ecosystems that prevent
deforestation in the regions of Rondônia and Amapá and
for the reforestation of the Amazon forest with native
species. They also foster the social and economic
development of local communities by generating
income and developing educational activities. Telefónica Germany cancelled credits from a
reforestation project in Colombia that promotes the
sustainable management of forest resources to foster
natural regeneration, for a quantity equivalent to 80% of
its operational emissions.
Lastly, Telefónica, S.A. mitigated 75% of the impact of
the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from its corporate
premises by removing an equivalent amount of CO2
 from
the atmosphere. This was achieved through a
reforestation project based in Colombia and another
restoration program involving hillside woodland
containing chestnut, oak and pine trees in San Esteban
de Budiño, in Spain.
E1-7_11, E1-7_19
One of the targets set for 2025 is to offset the Group’s
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in its main markets (Spain,
Germany and Brazil). In 2024, Telefónica offset 72% for
its main markets and 14% globally. Meeting this interim
target will mean cancelling 295,000 carbon credits
between 2025 and 2030, according to the Company’s

emissions directly within our operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions) or in cooperation and collaboration with relevant
stakeholders in our value chain (Scope 3 GHG emissions). While we acknowledge the potential role of GHG removals and GHG
mitigation projects financed through carbon credits in achieving net-zero targets, these are not currently part of our strategy. We
consider these measures to be supplementary to our direct emission reduction efforts and view them as a last resort to achieve
Net-Zero once substantial emission reductions have been achieved.
A1 Group does not currently engage in GHG removals or finance GHG mitigation projects through carbon credits. Our strategy
emphasizes reducing our operational GHG emissions by focusing on energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and optimizing our network operations. We believe that direct emission reductions are the most effective and credible way to
contribute to climate change mitigation.
A1 Group recognizes that achieving Net-Zero GHG emissions may eventually require GHG removal solutions. Our approach to
GHG removals would be defined by the following principles:
• Principle 1 – Emission Reduction First: Our priority is to achieve a 90 % reduction in GHG emissions from our baseline before considering any form of GHG removal. This focus ensures that we are tackling the root causes of emissions within our
operations and supply chain.
• Principle 2 – Technological Maturity and Credibility: We will only consider GHG removal technologies when they have
matured to a point where they meet high standards of credibility, effectiveness, and verification. A1 Group is committed to
ensuring that any future GHG removal efforts are based on scientifically sound, transparent, and verifiable methods. This
approach will help us maintain integrity and trust in our climate action strategies.
• Principle 3 – Alignment with Net-Zero Goals: Any future and potential GHG removal initiatives will be aligned with our longterm Net-Zero targets. We will ensure that these initiatives contribute meaningfully to our overall climate strategy and are
not used as substitutes for direct emission reduction efforts.
A1 Group is committed to transparency and accountability in our climate-related activities. Although we are not currently engaged in GHG removals or carbon credit projects, we will continue to:
• Regularly review the landscape of GHG removal technologies and carbon credit projects to assess their potential role in our
future strategy.
• Monitor developments in standards and best practices for GHG removals and ensure alignment with international frameworks and guidelines.
• Report on our progress and position regarding GHG removals in our reports, providing stakeholders with clear and transparent information about our approach.",0,,,,,,,

not have a net-zero, long-term target yet. We therefore do
not currently consider GHG removals as part of our climate
mitigation strategy to reach our targets in our own operations,
nor in our upstream and downstream value chain, and we are
not investigating technical carbon removal solutions.
We resort to buying Gold Standard and VCS carbon credits
from the voluntary carbon markets for meeting our rotating
credit facilities performance targets and our 2025 climateneutrality goals. How many credits we purchase is dictated
by our rotating credit facility performance targets and our
actual performance with respect to SF6
 leakages and mobility.
Refer to the paragraph “TenneT’s sustainable Revolving
Credit Facility: linking climate performance to finance” in
section Transition to a brighter energy future within social
and planetary boundaries. We also purchase Gold Standard
carbon credits to offset part of the emissions from the
consumption of natural gas of our non-technical locations,
relating to the natural gas consumption in our offices.
TenneT follows a three-step approach for both our 2025
climate-neutrality and 2030 targets. We aim to reduce our
direct and indirect emissions, and where this is not possible,
to green our emissions by using market-based instruments.
Where our efforts in reducing and greening do not succeed
due to the nature of our operations, we purchase carbon
credits to fulfil our term facility-linked performance metrics
and our 2025 climate-neutrality target. For our 2030 SBTi
targets, offsetting using carbon credits is not a consideration
since our targets relate to absolute emission reductions. Like
any neutrality claim, we direct our focus to reducing our
emissions in line with our absolute emission reduction targets
and for the parts which we absolutely cannot avoid given
our role as a critical infrastructure operator, we resort to
buying carbon offsets only to meet our 2025 climate-neutrality
goals. The challenge therefore remains to reduce grid losses
sufficiently and therefore achieving our climate-neutrality 2025
goal. This does not interfere with our 2030 SBTi targets, since
these are an absolute reduction target with reference to a
2019 baseline.
Our Gold Standard and VCS carbon credits are purchased
through the voluntary carbon market. Certification of the
credits are a minimum requirement and are subjected
to availability in the voluntary carbon market. We opt
for renewable energy projects in developing countries. All
Gold Standard and VCS-certified activities follow a Gs4GG
certification process. Activities must deliver impact on a
minimum of three UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) and ensure that climate initiatives also work for
climate justice, by delivering benefits to SDGs such as
no poverty, good health and wellbeing, gender equality,
water and sanitation, affordable clean energy, ecosystem and
biodiversity conservation, and of course climate action. In line
with the gender-sensitive design principles, all Gold Standard
and VCS-certified activities must take into account the overall
societal context from a gender perspective and comply with
gender equality and women’s empowerments requirements.
Given the developments within the voluntary carbon markets,
we choose our credits carefully but are limited to the market

firm that is a subsidiary of Bouygues Construction), aims to
support the Bouygues Group's business lines in the voluntary
carbon market with a view to restoring carbon sinks, and only to
the extent of their residual and irreducible emissions.
This initiative, which is dedicated to the engineering involved in
restoring carbon sinks aims to support them in their climate
strategies over the long term. Rejeneo has forged partnerships
with ecosystem restoration specialists (such as Agoterra and La
Société Forestière) and carries out due diligence on suggested
projects to ensure that they address local biodiversity issues and
that all resources are implemented and provided with a view to
ensuring that the expected outcomes are eventually achieved.
The TF1 group has set itself strict quality criteria on the nature of
the certificates purchased, on the types of project (only naturebased projects), on the targeted regions, the recognised carbon
standards and on the proven co-benefits for local communities
and biodiversity.
In parallel with the TF1 group's priority decarbonisation efforts,
this initiative represents a means of contributing both to climate
change mitigation beyond the Group's value chains, and to the
conservation and restoration of habitats that are critical for
biodiversity, local communities and climate change adaptation.
However, and in accordance with the GHG Protocol, the amount of
purchased carbon credits is not deducted from the scope 1, 2
and 3 emissions reported by the Group. Accordingly, the TF1
group states that none of the carbon credit financing activities
that it has previously carried out or will carry out in the future are
aimed at offsetting its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as part of
the E1-6 disclosure requirement on GHG emissions. In terms of
its own operations, the TF1 group has not identified any potential
means of absorbing or storing GHGs but has, however, financed
projects outside its value chain that contribute to the natural
absorption of GHGs.
Without waiting for the declaration of Net Zero targets, the TF1
group is already financing high-integrity carbon sequestration
credits in order to ultimately achieve a balance between residual
and irreducible emissions and sequestered emissions.
In this context, TF1's ad sales house, TF1 Pub, has financed
projects in France recognised by the Bas Carbone (low carbon)
Label. TF1 Pub has supported 9 of these projects since 2022:
● afforestation and reforestation projects;
● arable crop farming projects;
● agroforestry projects.","1,976",100,0,Label Bas Carbone,100,0,,

method of contributing to climate change mitigation. High-quality carbon credits are essential, as they ensure
that the projects funded are genuinely effective in reducing or removing GHG emissions. Quality carbon credits
have considered topics like additionality, durability, leakage, external verification of the methodology and
calculations, and evaluation of the impacts on other sustainability areas.
Tietoevry cancelled carbon credits which corresponds to 1 280 metric tonnes of CO2eq for voluntary offsets of
its own GHG emissions related to operations in Norway. 100% of these carbon reduction credits were
purchased from two Gold Standard programme projects in India. Gold Standard programmes qualify as a
corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The main purpose of the projects’ activity is to
generate electricity through sustainable means using solar power and wind power resources. The generated
renewable electricity will contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.
All credits are issued by default after the annual monitoring and verification process, and 10% of all credits are
pooled into a buffer account. If any reversals occur in the projects, the carbon losses are covered through the
cancellation of an equivalent number of buffer credits from the buffer pool. The carbon credits have been issued
in accordance with the relevant standard’s protocols and are tracked in the registry to prevent double counting
or double selling. The serial number of the credits cancelled is available. No adjustments have been issued for
these carbon credits. The carbon credit projects that Tietoevry invests in include:
• Renewable energy projects (wind power generation) with distribution within the Indian power grid
• Renewable energy (solar power generation) projects within selected Indian states
Tietoevry is aiming to reach net zero in scope 1 and 2 by 2026. In connection to this commitment, the plan is to

Uniper has not acquired any carbon credits that finance climate change mitigation projects for GHG reductions or removals. In the future, however, Uniper also plans to explore opportunities within the voluntary carbon market, provided that the potential activities are in line with Uniper's strategic objectives and would maximize benefits for Uniper's stakeholders. Against this background, options can be kept open to pursue the best approaches of this evolving market.
Uniper plans to participate in the carbon offsets trading market and will monitor it closely. Additionally, it retains the option to purchase carbon offsets as a last resort in alignment with its future neutralization claims.
Uniper does not disclose a net zero target.
In addition to the strategic actions listed above (see chapter E1-3) to achieve its GHG emissions reduction targets, Uniper will offset the GHG emissions remaining after the reduction with CO, certificates meeting Uniper's internal quality standards in order to achieve carbon neutrality in all Scopes (Scopes 1 to 3) by the year 2040.
Further details on Uniper's Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 reduction targets can be found in chapter E1-4.
Uniper has ensured that its carbon neutrality claims and reliance on carbon credits do not impede or reduce the achievement of the set GHG emissions reduction targets through its aim to set GHG abatement as the priority mitigation measure before relying on carbon credits. The achievement of Uniper's aforementioned targets include technical, new products and portfolio reconfiguration solutions. Further details regarding Uniper's targets can be found in chapter E1-4.
For the purchase of carbon credits in the future, Uniper has created a set of quality standards for the selection of carbon credits that aims to support the identification of high-quality carbon credits and eligible project types. In 2024, these minimum quality standards were updated based on the Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) of ICVCM, ICVCM's assessment of carbon credit registries and the updated Oxford Principles by the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.
The minimum quality standards consider the following criteria:
• Registration of carbon offset credits within a verified carbon credit registry program according to ICROA and ICVCM (e.g., Verra, CAR, ACR, etc.)
• Verification of carbon offset credits by independent third parties
• Quality of carbon offset credits including permanence and shifting (carbon leakage) and ensuring the avoidance of double counting
• Project type and category including the verification of the project's GHG emissions and removals
• Rules for calculation and monitoring
Uniper will continue to monitor regulatory developments involving carbon credits accountability in the EU and other relevant nations such as the ongoing communications of the European Commission on industrial carbon management the ICVCM guidelines and update the quality standards accordingly.

A carbon-free energy supply is not currently possible for global energy requirements. Energy efficiency there-
fore remains an important basis for effective climate change mitigation and should always be the first lever.
Ultimately, the remaining energy needs requirements be covered with as much carbon efficiency as possible (second priority lever). This involves reviewing innovative energy concepts, direct integration of renewable energies, and technological changes such as electrification.
In the area of hard-to-abate emissions, the Volkswagen Group is considering using climate action projects to offset them, for example to achieve net COze-neutral production (third priority lever). Emissions are considered to be hard to abate if avoiding them is either not currently technically possible or would be disproportionately expensive and therefore not economically feasible. As part of the net COze-neutral transition, the Volkswagen Group continues to offset unavoidable emissions from the life cycle phases, such as from the supply chain or production, through climate action projects with high certification standards. These include the VCS, the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB Standards) and the Gold Standard. In addition to external certification standards, offsetting projects for quality assurance are also assessed in accordance with our own criteria.
The Volkswagen Group intends to continue to observe the highest quality and certification standards in carbon offsetting (carbon credits) to achieve the long-term climate targets. The carbon offsetting approach is used for all emission categories from Scope 1 to Scope 3. Once all actions to increase efficiency and reduce emissions as outlined in our transition plan have been implemented, we intend to offset particularly hard-to-abate emissions through carbon offset projects. This will affect less than 10% of emissions. This is based on the requirements of the SBTi.
If carbon credits are used to achieve decarbonization targets, they are used to ensure net carbon-neutral delivery of the battery-electric vehicles. The only carbon credits we use are those that meet the standards of VERRA and Gold Standard. We did not use carbon credits from any other standards in the reporting year.
Metrics on carbon credits
As a general rule, the carbon credits used by the Volkswagen Group must meet the highest quality standards. For this reason, they are only acquired from certain project types and from appropriately prequalified companies. The Volkswagen Group only accepts certain issuing standards for the carbon credits themselves.
The underlying projects are implemented in accordance with publicly verifiable and scientifically based
methodologies. The results of these projects are verified by independent third parties.
Each carbon credit used by the Volkswagen Group represents -1 ton of COze. After purchase, the carbon
credit is always transferred to Volkswagen Group accounts and only then used (usually at a later date).","6,076,738",0,100,"Gold Standard, VCS",0,0,,

compensated to fulfil our ambition strategy (see also B.2.2.5
Policies and targets). At this stage, and as specified in the
TRUST 2025 programme, emissions to be offset are Scope 1,
2 and 3.6 emissions. Worldline plans to progressively target
the other categories of scope 3, while pursuing reduction
initiatives.
As to the type of project, Worldline finances two projects
outside its value chain. India's coal-based power industry is the most resourcewasting and polluting in the world. Installing wind turbine
generators of a total 105MW capacity is the main objective
of the Zenyatta project, which would produce clean
electricity using renewable wind resources. The project era
is located in the central Indian districts of Ujjain and Dewas
in the state of Madhya Pradesh. In an electrical grid highly
reliant on fossil fuels, wind power generation lessens the
requirement for electricity generation. This decreases the
quantity of greenhouse gases released into the environment
and air pollution, both of which have detrimental effects on
the health of the local population.
The initiative support other key social and environmental
aspect through SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by
funding healthcare initiatives, benefiting 9,921 individuals,
including 2,480 who received direct support through project
revenue. Under SDG 4 (Quality Education), infrastructure
improvements in local schools have enhanced educational
opportunities for 175 students. For SDG 8 (Decent Work and
Economic Growth), it has created 48 direct jobs during
construction and operation, ensuring long-term stability for
local workers. Additionally, 74 training sessions were held to
support skill development and workforce empowerment.
The project follows the ACM0002 methodology under the
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) to quantify emission
reductions. It compares actual renewable energy generation
to a baseline scenario where electricity would have been
produced from fossil fuels. Emissions avoided are calculated
using a Combined Margin (CM) approach, ensuring accurate
and conservative estimates. Energy generation is monitored
through Joint Meter Readings (JMR), with results verified by
independent third parties to ensure transparency and
reliability.
More precisely, this methodology is for “Consolidated
Baseline Methodology for grid connected electricity
generation from renewable sources” and small scale
methodology AMS-I.D. It places a limit of 4 W/m² on the
power density of hydroelectric power plants (HEPP) to
prevent methane emission from vegetation in the submerged
area. The Estuary Restauration Project involves the replanting of
5.68 hectares of forest that was destroyed by a wildfire in
Belin-Béliet, France (33830). The aim of the program is to
reforest the land with maritime pine, with secondary species
such as cork oak and warty birch at the edges, which can act
as firebreaks. Maritime pine has been present in the region
for over 200 years and has been successfully planted here
thanks to the damp soils of the Médoc. It is well adapted to
sandy soils and has good resistance to heat waves thanks to
its shallow roots. As for hardwoods, their elasticity in
relation to their water requirements makes them ideal
species for ensuring their establishment and longevity.
The initiative makes substantial contributions to multiple
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It tackles SDG 15
(Life on Land) by promoting reforestation with a diverse mix
of local tree species, preserving natural habitats, and
supporting pollinators through the maintenance of beehives.
Under SDG 13 (Climate Action), the project helps remove
CO₂ from the atmosphere, aligning with France’s carbon
neutrality goals. For SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and
Production), the initiative implements sustainable forestry
management practices, reducing soil degradation and
minimizing disturbance through improved plantation
techniques. Additionally, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic
Growth) is supported through local job creation, the
development of regional forestry industries, and knowledge
sharing in sustainable land management practices.
The project follows the Label Bas Carbone’s Reboisement
methodology, which aims at restoring existing forest and
ensures accurate measurement of carbon sequestration
through a structured process. It begins with baseline
establishment, assessing the carbon stock lost due to the
fire and defining the sequestration potential of the
reforested land. Next, carbon storage calculations use
growth models and field data to estimate the CO₂ absorption
capacity of the newly planted forest. The project undergoes
monitoring and verification, with regular audits to track tree
survival rates, growth, and carbon sequestration
performance. Finally, certification and credit issuance involve
independent third-party verification, ensuring that only
verifiable emissions reductions are credited under Label Bas Carbone standard. ","12,000",6,94,"Label Bas Carbone, VCS",6,0,,
